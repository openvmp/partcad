"""One coverage report out of every job's coverage data, and the gate that reads it.

CI measures coverage in five jobs -- `Pytest`, `Behave`, both example sweeps and
`Repo //pub` -- each fanned out over operating systems and interpreters, and each
covering a different part of the same source. No one of those numbers means
anything on its own: the pytest job never runs a CAD sandbox, the behave job
drives the installed `pc` and never imports a unit-test helper, and the example
sweeps walk success paths and nothing else. What a reader wants is the union,
which is what Codecov used to compute after every job posted to it.

This script is that union, computed in the repository instead of a third-party
service, in three steps that the "Coverage" job in `test.yml` runs as three
steps of its own:

  `merge`   Combine every `.coverage` data file the run produced into one, and
            write the HTML, Cobertura and JSON reports from it. The union is
            `coverage combine`'s, not this script's: line numbers are unioned
            per file, so a line executed by behave on Windows and missed by
            pytest on Linux counts as covered once. `[paths]` in
            `dev-tools/coverage.rc` is what lets it recognise the same file
            recorded under three different roots -- see the comment there.

  `render`  Turn the merged JSON into the markdown that goes into the job
            summary and into the pull request comment. Kept separate from
            `merge` because the comment carries a link to the uploaded HTML
            report, and that URL does not exist until the artifact is uploaded,
            which cannot happen until `merge` has produced the report.

  `check`   Apply the coverage requirement and exit non-zero if it is not met.
            Separate again so that the pull request is updated first: a red gate
            with no comment explaining it is a gate nobody can act on.

The requirement is a floor under *patch* coverage -- the statements this pull
request added or changed -- and the floor is the project's own statement
coverage in the same run. Nothing is stored between runs and nothing is compared
with history: the bar is "cover what you write at least as well as this
repository is already covered", which is self-calibrating and cannot go red on
the day it lands. `--min-patch` takes an absolute percentage instead, and
`--patch-tolerance` allows a slack in percentage points, for when that is the
policy somebody wants.

Two rates are reported and they are not interchangeable, which is why both are
in the table rather than one blended number. coverage.py's headline rate counts
branches as well as statements (`branch = True` in `coverage.rc`), and a diff
cannot say which arcs of a partially-taken branch are "new". So the requirement
is stated in statements at both ends -- patch against project -- and the branch
and overall rates are reported beside them for the reader.
