//
// The PartCAD Viewer panel, inside the webview.
//
// Geometry is only the first of what the panel has to say about what is on
// screen. An assembly also has a bill of materials and a set of assembly
// instructions, and anything that can be bought has suppliers and prices, so the
// panel is a strip of tabs over one object rather than a canvas:
//
//     3D  |  Bill of Materials  |  Instructions  |  Supply
//
// Which of them exist depends on what is being shown - see 'tabsFor()' - and the
// 3D view is always the first, because that is what "show this part" means.
//
// This file is the shell: it owns the tab strip and the panes, routes what the
// extension host posts in, and asks for the contents of a tab the first time it
// is looked at. Each pane draws itself ('scene.ts', 'bom.ts', 'document.ts',
// 'supply.ts'); none of them talks to the host directly.
//
// Everything but the 3D view is answered by the PartCAD daemon, which this
// renderer cannot reach: the panel's CSP forbids every network request, and the
// daemon is behind the extension host's JSON-RPC connection anyway. So a pane's
// contents are asked for ('fetchTab') and delivered ('tabData'), never fetched.
