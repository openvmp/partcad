//
// Licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.
//
// The PartCAD Viewer's 3D view: the renderer behind the first tab of the panel.
//
// Runs inside the webview, not in the extension host, so it has no access to
// 'vscode' or to node - the geometry arrives over postMessage as base64 binary
// glTF and is parsed straight out of memory. There is deliberately no network
// request anywhere in this file; the panel's CSP forbids one.
//
// The presentation follows 'react-partcad-prerendered' (see its
// 'src/components/Part.js'), which is the viewer PartCAD already ships on the
// web, so that a part looks the same in the IDE as it does on partcad.org:
//
//   * an auto-rotating orbit camera, framed on the model;
//   * drei's <Stage> lighting - an environment map plus an ambient/spot/point
//     trio scaled from the model's size - with contact shadows underneath;
//   * the hemisphere and point lights Part.js adds on top of Stage;
//   * MeshPhongMaterial;
//   * a loading overlay showing the model size and progress.
//
// Two deliberate departures from Part.js, both forced by the webview: React and
// react-three-fiber are not used (a lot of bundle for one canvas), and the
// environment is three's procedural RoomEnvironment rather than drei's
// environment="city" preset, which is an HDRI fetched from a CDN that the CSP
// blocks and that would not work offline.
//
// A third difference is not a choice. Part.js loads OBJ, a format with no scene
// graph and no units, so it has to rotate the model by -90 degrees about X
// itself to stand PartCAD's Z-up geometry up in a Y-up scene. glTF has both:
// build123d's export_gltf writes that same rotation into the node transform and
// converts millimetres to glTF's metres, so the model arrives correctly oriented
// and rotating it again here would lay it on its side. Only the port markers,
// which come from PartCAD as raw millimetre Z-up locations rather than through
// the exporter, still need the conversion applied - see MM_TO_M/Z_UP_TO_Y_UP.
