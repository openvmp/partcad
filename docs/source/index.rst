`PartCAD <https://github.com/openvmp/partcad>`_
is the first build system and package manager for CAD models
and a framework for creating assemblies.
It complements Git with everything necessary to substitute
commercial Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools.

PartCAD maintains information about mechanical parts and
how they come together to form larger assemblies.
The same parts are reused in multiple assemblies and multiple projects.
And all of that is supercharged by the ultimate versioning and collaboration features of Git.
