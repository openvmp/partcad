PartCAD

`PartCAD <https://github.com/openvmp/partcad>`_
is the first build system and package manager for CAD models,
and a framework for creating assemblies.

PartCAD allows maintenance information about mechanical parts,
how they come together to form larger assemblies
and to reuse the same parts in multiple assemblies, and multiple projects.
The implementation of parts can change over time
(e.g. optimize or migrate to ``build123d`` from ``STEP``) without the need to
update all of the part consumers.
