===============

You can make a huge impact on lots of people by simply creating a simple post
or a basic video tutorial for PartCAD in your social media accounts.
It is very much appreciated.

PartCAD Public Repository
=========================

Besides main PartCAD software components, you can contribute to the community by publishing design data
as well as pluggable software modules to PartCAD Public Repository.

Assemblies
----------

Migrate your products to PartCAD by creating and publishing Assembly YAML files
for your products. Eliminate the need to develop and maintain a custom way to
store and to publish assembly instructions and bills of materials.
Enable the use or your assemblies in other PartCAD projects.

Start by creating a package (in a dedicated git repository)
for all products by your company or community.
Then add parametrized assembly declarations to the package.

The best way to write Assembly YAML files is to use the PartCAD VS Code extension
and its code completion features. Select the part you want to add in the explorer
view on the left. Then, in the Assembly YAML file editor, start typing ``- part:``
(including the trailing space) as if you were adding a new part to the assembly.
After you type ``- pa``, a code
completion suggestion appears that adds the complete YAML block for the selected
part.

Parts
-----

Publish your parts in the PartCAD Public Repository to enable their use (and
purchase if applicable) by other PartCAD users.

Start by creating a package (in a dedicated git repository)
for all parts and assemblies created by your company
or community, if you didn't do that yet.
Then add part declarations to the package.

If CAD files already exist for these parts, then you should probably start by
using those CAD files first. You can always migrate to Code-CAD technologies
(such as OpenSCAD, CadQuery, build123d or sdf) later. However you might want to host
the CAD files separately from the package's git repository
(and have PartCAD fetch them using `fileFrom: url`,
even if they are hosted in another git repository)
so that you do not blow up the repository size and
slow your projects down in perpetuity by a temporary use of legacy CAD files.

After that declare the location of ports.
This will enable connecting parts to each other, instead of placing them using
absolute and relative coordinates and ensuring they remain properly co-located
using finger-crossing guarantees.
Whenever possible, use interfaces and mating declarations instead of pure ports,
so that it's easier for PartCAD (including AIs using PartCAD) to determine
which parts are meant to be connected to which parts, and how exactly they need
to be connected.

Interfaces
----------

The most challenging step of adding parts is to declare all the ports.
This effort can be significantly reduced for all PartCAD users globally
by extending the library of standard interfaces.

Does your part have a port of the kind also found in many other parts?
Consider declaring a reusable interface.

Providers
---------

Advertise your online store and manufacturing services by integrating your API
with PartCAD.

Decide which one is more appropriate for your business:
``store`` or ``manufacturer``. Then see an existing provider implementation of
that kind as a reference. Alternatively, reach out to the PartCAD team to get
help with the implementation. Be at the forefront of the next industrial
revolution together with PartCAD!

Help a Friend
-------------

Do you know an opensource project that maintains assembly instructions or doing
something else that can be radically improved by using PartCAD?
Do you know a business that uses legacy tools and struggles to scale
collaboration in the era of Git?
Do you know a local additive manufacturing shop that can use more local
customers?
Do you know a collection of parts that the community can really benefit from if
only these parts and corresponding assembly ideas were easily discoverable?

Help them migrate to PartCAD!

How to contribute?
******************

.. _Environment:

Environment
===========

Our team is using `Visual Studio Code`_ and `Docker`_ which boosts
software development by providing a powerful, customizable editor and ensuring consistent environments with
containerization.

VS Code's rich extensions and debugging tools integrate seamlessly with Docker, allowing developers to write, test, and
debug code within containers.

This setup eliminates environment inconsistencies, accelerates development, and improves team collaboration.

Docker
------

`Docker`_ helps build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere — without tedious environment configuration or
management. There are two main options how to setup Docker.

If you do not have previous experience with Docker, then here is good place to start:

- `Docker Docs - Get Started`_

Engine
------

If your primary development system is Linux then you can install Docker daemon directly on your host, see `Install`_ for
more details on how to install it in the distribution you're using. Minimum required versions:

- Docker Engine: v27.4.0 or higher
- Docker Desktop for Mac/Windows: 4.37.1 or higher

.. note::

    *`Docker Engine`_ is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications.
    Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:*

    - A server with a long-running daemon process `dockerd`_.
    - APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
    - A command line interface (CLI) client `Docker`_.

    The CLI uses `Docker APIs`_ to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands.
    Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI. The daemon creates and manages Docker objects, such as
    images, containers, networks, and volumes.

    For more details, see `Docker Architecture`_.

Desktop
-------

If you're working on macOS or Windows, you can still install Engine, but that would require managing a local Linux VM.
Docker Desktop provides a convenient solution and handles the required virtualization for you:

- `Install on Mac`_
- `Install on Windows`_

.. note::

    *`Docker Desktop` is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment that lets you build,
    share, and run containerized applications and microservices.*

Visual Studio Code
==================

VS Code available for macOS, Linux, and Windows, has extensible architecture and has rich customization and integration
options. Here is good place to get familiar with it:

- `Setting up Visual Studio Code`_

.. note::

    *Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense
    code completion and debugging.*

    *First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle
    means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.*

  :width: 80%
  :align: center
  :alt: A screenshot of a Visual Studio Code environment. The terminal window shows a behave command being executed to test BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) scenarios for a PartCAD project.

Dev Containers
--------------

VS Code also provides seamless integration with Docker for managing environments by supporting `Dev Containers`_
specification.

.. note::

    _The Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment.
    It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full
    feature set. A `devcontainer.json`_ file in your project tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development
    container with a well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an application or to separate
    tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase._

Quick Start
===========

.. note::

  Following tutorial assumes that you have previous experience with both `VS Code`_ and `Docker`_ or have read
  `Environment`_ first.

Overall process starting from setting up environment till merging changes in default branch is the following:

1. Clone Git Repository.
2. Install Python Dependencies.
3. Activate Virtual Environment.
4. Make Changes in Source Files.
5. Run Tests.
6. Commit & Push Changes.
7. Open Pull Request.
8. Meet PR Merge Criteria.

Retrieve the Source Code
------------------------

Due to variations in Docker setup across operating systems, this step has distinct best practices. Please follow the
section for your OS below. Once you have cloned the repository, VS Code will start the Dev Container.

The last time we've measured, the size of base Docker Image with all system-level dependencies baked in is 2.83 GB, main highlights are:

- APT Packages: 770.56 MB
- Git: 423.87 MB
- Python: 411.28 MB
- Common Utils: 251.11 MB
- Debian (Bookworm): 116.56 MB

Mac & Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  .. warning::

    Since macOS and Windows run containers in a VM, "`bind`_" mounts are not as fast as using the container's filesystem
    directly. Fortunately, Docker has the concept of a local "`named volume`_" that can act like the container's
    filesystem but survives container rebuilds. This makes it ideal for storing package folders like ``node_modules``,
    data folders, or output folders like ``build`` where write performance is critical.

  In order to have optimal performance use the following documentation, but when prompted to provide GitHub repository
  name use ``partcad/partcad`` to clone our main repository:

  - `Open a Git repository or GitHub PR in an isolated container volume`_

Linux
^^^^^

  Since Linux can run Docker Engine directly on your host system, you can use the following documentation to bootstrap
  environment.

  - `Open an existing folder in a container`_

Without VS Code: Dev Containers CLI
-----------------------------------

If you do not use VS Code — or you are automating the workflow, for example from a coding agent — you can enter the same
environment from a terminal with the `Dev Containers CLI`_. It reads the same ``.devcontainer/devcontainer.json``, so
you get the same image, features, mounts, and lifecycle commands the VS Code extension would give you.

Start the environment from the repository root on your host. The first run is slow while features are installed:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npx --yes @devcontainers/cli up --workspace-folder .

Then run any command inside it:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npx --yes @devcontainers/cli exec --workspace-folder . <command>

The project virtual environment is not activated automatically and ``pytest``, ``pc``, and ``partcad`` are not on
``$PATH``, so prefix project commands with ``poetry run``:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npx --yes @devcontainers/cli exec --workspace-folder . poetry run pc version

.. note::

  ``poetry.toml`` sets ``in-project = true``, so the virtual environment lives at ``./.venv`` inside the bind-mounted
  workspace and is shared between your host and the container. If you run ``poetry`` on both sides, each will rebuild
  ``.venv`` because the interpreter paths recorded in it are only valid on one side. Keep Python work on one side.

Committing from the CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run ``git commit`` **inside** the environment. That is where ``pre-commit`` is installed, by the ``postStartCommand``
declared in ``.devcontainer/devcontainer.json``:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npx --yes @devcontainers/cli exec --workspace-folder . git commit -m "<message>"

If you commit on the host instead, the commit fails with ``` `pre-commit` not found ```. The ``.git/hooks/pre-commit``
script is generated by ``pre-commit install`` running inside the container, so it refers to an interpreter path that
only exists there. Re-run the commit inside the environment rather than bypassing the hooks with ``--no-verify``.

The VS Code extension copies your host git identity into the container, but the CLI does not, and anything written to
the container's home directory is lost when the container is recreated. If the commit fails with ``Author identity
unknown``, set the identity repo-locally — ``.git/config`` lives in the bind-mounted workspace, so it survives
container recreates and is never committed:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git config --local user.name "<your name>"
  $ git config --local user.email "<your email>"

.. warning::

  Do not mount your host ``~/.gitconfig`` into the container to solve this. If it contains ``url.*.insteadOf`` rules
  that rewrite ``https://github.com/`` to SSH — a common setup — the ``git-lfs`` feature's post-create step will
  attempt SSH, find no key inside the container, and fail the entire ``up``.

If you sign your commits, note that the VS Code extension forwards your GPG agent automatically but the CLI does not —
the container will have your public key but no private key, and the commit fails to sign. Forward the agent's extra
socket when starting the environment, which keeps your private key on the host:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npx --yes @devcontainers/cli up --workspace-folder . \
      --mount "type=bind,source=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-extra-socket),target=/run/host-gpg-agent.sock"

Then point the container's agent socket at the forwarded one. Note the socket lives under ``/run/user/$(id -u)/gnupg/``,
not ``~/.gnupg/``:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
  $ ln -sf /run/host-gpg-agent.sock /run/user/$(id -u)/gnupg/S.gpg-agent

.. _Dev Containers CLI: https://github.com/devcontainers/cli

Without Docker: a native checkout
---------------------------------

Both routes above start a container, and a container needs a Docker daemon. Some machines have none and cannot be
given one — the sandbox a cloud coding agent runs in, a CI runner with no privileged access. There the dev container
is not a thing to insist on, so install into the checkout and run everything directly:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./dev-tools/setup-native.sh

That runs ``poetry install``, installs OpenSCAD, checks for the one thing a parallel install can get wrong (below),
and reports what else this machine has. Afterwards, every command in the rest of this page works with its
``devcontainer exec`` prefix dropped and its ``poetry run`` kept.

OpenSCAD is installed rather than merely reported because PartCAD treats it as part of the toolchain and not as an
optional extra: the standalone bundles carry one, ``pc healthcheck`` asks after it, and a ``.scad`` part raises
"OpenSCAD executable is not found" rather than degrading. The script uses ``apt-get`` or Homebrew, and stops if it has
neither — an environment without OpenSCAD is not set up, and finding that out from a test run half an hour later is
the outcome this avoids.

This is still a fallback rather than a second supported environment, and it is worth being explicit about what it does
not give you:

* **The** ``pre-commit`` **hooks do not run.** ``pre-commit`` is installed by the dev container's image, not by
  ``poetry install``, and ``.git/hooks/pre-commit`` is written by ``pre-commit install`` running inside the container.
  So there is no hook to fail, and ``git commit`` runs no gate at all without saying so. Run ``pytest``, ``behave``
  and the linters yourself before committing; CI runs them regardless. The linter that gates is ``isort``:

  .. code-block:: bash

     poetry run isort --check --diff --filter-files --settings-path pyproject.toml src tests

  ``--filter-files`` is what makes the ``extend_skip``/``extend_skip_glob`` entries in ``pyproject.toml`` apply to
  files named on the command line, and those entries are not style preferences — they hold the import order that the
  CAD sandbox wrappers need in order to pin expat before OCP loads. ``black`` and ``flake8`` are configured but do not
  gate; the root ``AGENTS.md`` says what each would take to turn on.
* **A Docker daemon**, which only the KiCad example needs. Without one that example is skipped, whether the machine
  said so in advance — ``PC_USE_DOCKER=false`` in the environment, or ``useDocker: false`` in the user configuration —
  or the daemon simply is not answering. Having no container runtime is the one thing that test passes over: an image
  it cannot pull, a ``kicad-cli`` that errors and a part that comes back empty all still fail it, because those are the
  KiCad path being broken rather than the machine lacking a feature.
* **conda**, without which the ``pythonSandbox`` option falls back to ``venv``. That builds a real virtual environment
  of PartCAD's own and runs the CAD wrappers in it; it just cannot provision an *interpreter version*, so a package
  asking for a Python this host does not have renders on the host's instead and says so.

.. important::

  **Do not run the whole** ``behave`` **suite on such a machine — run the one feature your change touches.** Every
  scenario takes a throwaway ``$HOME`` (the ``Given I have temporary $HOME`` in each feature's ``Background``), so a
  scenario that renders anything builds a CAD sandbox of its own from nothing and deletes it again: roughly 2.7 GB
  and minutes of ``pip`` each, across 166 scenarios, and several of those on disk at once under ``behavex``'s
  parallel workers. That is hours and tens of gigabytes, and where the disk is a fixed allowance it ends in "no
  space left on device" rather than in a result.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run behave features/<name>.feature      # yes
    $ poetry run behave                              # no, not here

  A green whole-suite ``behave`` is not a prerequisite for opening a pull request from a machine like this: CI shards
  that suite and runs it there. Say in the pull request which features you did run.

.. warning::

  **Two wheels that install the same file can leave the checkout segfaulting, and nothing reports it.** Poetry
  installs in parallel, so on a machine slow enough to lose that race both workers write that one path at once and
  what lands is a blend of the two wheels. Both installs report success.

  What you see is much later and somewhere else: an ``import`` of a native module like that hands a corrupt ELF to
  the dynamic loader, and the interpreter dies with ``Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault`` — during pytest
  *collection*, if a test module imports it at import time, so no test has failed and there is nothing to point at.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run python dev-tools/check_installed_files.py         # report
    $ poetry run python dev-tools/check_installed_files.py --fix   # report and reinstall

  ``setup-native.sh`` runs the second of those. The dev container's image installs from
  ``.devcontainer/requirements.txt`` with pip, one wheel at a time, which is why this is not the container's problem.

  The pair that did this was ``cadquery-ocp`` and ``cadquery-ocp-novtk``, which both ship one 160 MB
  ``OCP/OCP.cpython-*.so``. ``cadquery-ocp`` is no longer declared in ``pyproject.toml`` — nothing in this
  environment imports ``cadquery`` in process, and build123d pulls the novtk build in regardless — so one
  distribution owns that file and it can no longer be written twice. The checker stays for the next such pair, which
  will not announce itself either.

  It also stays for the other half of the same problem, which **an existing checkout will hit exactly once**:
  uninstalling a distribution deletes the files its RECORD names, the ones a wheel beside it also installed
  included. So ``poetry sync`` removing ``cadquery-ocp`` takes ``OCP/`` away from ``cadquery-ocp-novtk``, which
  stays installed, and ``import OCP`` stops working with nothing in either command's output about it. The checker
  reports a distribution whose recorded files are gone, and ``--fix`` puts them back.

Install Dependencies
--------------------

We are using `Poetry`_ to manage dependencies and virtual environments.

.. note::

    Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your
    project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. Poetry offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable
    installs, and can build your project for distribution.

Once the Dev Container is started, open a shell session in the Terminal view of VS Code. The current working directory
will be ``/workspaces/partcad`` containing the source files. To install Python packages, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ poetry install

It will create virtual environment in ``.venv/`` directory and download about 1.5 GB dependencies. Once all dependencies
are downloaded Poetry will also install current package in editable mode, and you will see the following:

.. code-block::

  Installing the current project: partcad (0.8.84)

.. warning::

    **A checkout that predates the one-wheel layout needs cleaning out first.** This repository used to hold six
    Python distributions in six top-level directories -- ``partcad/``, ``partcad-cli/``, ``partcad-client/``,
    ``partcad-ide-client/``, ``partcad-service-json-rpc/``, ``partcad-utils/`` -- and to install a seventh,
    ``partcad-dev``, as the root project. Switching to the branch that collapsed them into ``src/`` leaves both
    behind, and neither goes away on its own:

    * ``git`` does not remove the old directories, because the only files still in them are ignored ones
      (``__pycache__/``, ``*.egg-info/``). They look empty and are not.
    * ``.venv`` keeps the ``partcad-dev`` install. Its ``.pth`` still puts the six deleted ``*/src`` directories on
      ``sys.path`` and its ``pc`` still points at the pre-rename entry point, so ``pc`` fails with
      ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'partcad_cli.click.command'``. ``poetry install`` does not replace it
      -- the distribution was renamed, so Poetry does not know it is there -- and ``pip uninstall partcad-dev``
      refuses to remove it, with ``ValueError: ('Invalid group name', 'poetry-multiproject-plugin')``, because the
      metadata it left behind names an entry point group that is not valid.

    Delete both from the repository root, then install again:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ rm -rf partcad partcad-cli partcad-client partcad-ide-client partcad-service-json-rpc partcad-utils
      $ rm -rf .venv/lib/python*/site-packages/partcad_dev.pth \
               .venv/lib/python*/site-packages/partcad_dev-*.dist-info
      $ poetry install

    A fresh clone needs none of this.

Activate Environment
--------------------

In order to update your ``$PATH`` and be able to run commandline tools such as ``pytest`` you need to activate virtual
environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ poetry shell

or

.. code-block:: bash

  $ $(poetry env activate)

After that you will be able to run ``pc``, for example ``pc version``, which will output something along the lines:

.. code-block::

  INFO:  PartCAD Python Module version: 0.7.40
  INFO:  PartCAD CLI version: 0.7.40

Make Changes
------------

Make the changes through Visual Studio Code how you would do for any other project.

Manual Tests
------------

To test functionality of the Python core module, use corresponding command line interface (CLI) commands.

To test CLI functionality, simply type commands in a shell session in the Terminal view of the VSCode where the development takes place.

To test VSCode plugin, run the following commands in a shell session in the Terminal view before restarting the VSCode:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ide/vscode
    $ npm ci
    $ npm run vsce-package
    $ code --install-extension partcad.vsix

To test the Python core module using the VSCode plugin, click the `Restart PartCAD` icon in the PartCAD's `Context` view after each change.

.. note::

  If you are developing inside the PartCAD Dev container using PartCAD VSCode extension, and are seeing this:

  .. code-block:: text

      ERROR: Failed to clone repo https://github.com/partcad/partcad-index.git after 0 retries

  then you are likely to have Git configured to use SSH creds to access GitHub,
  while the SSH creds are not available in the Dev container.

  This could be fixed by running ``ssh-add`` on the host
  and confirmed by running ``ssh-add -l`` inside the container.

To test documentation changes, run the following command before navigating your favorite VSCode browser extension to `./docs/build/html`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sphinx-build -M html docs/source docs/build -n -W

Alternatively, run the following command before navigating your favorite VSCode browser extension to `127.0.0.1:8000`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sphinx-autobuild --host 127.0.0.1 -b html docs/source docs/build

Automated Tests
---------------

Pytest
^^^^^^

PartCAD uses ``pytest`` for unit testing, where a particular piece of code or feature is tested.

If you `activated virtual environment`_ you can just run ``pytest`` from a bash session in the Terminal view of VSCode.

You can also use VS Code's built-in **Testing** integration to run and debug tests via the UI. To set this up:

1. Open the Command Palette (``Ctrl+Shift+P`` or ``Cmd+Shift+P``)
2. Run ``Python: Select Interpreter``
3. Select ``('.venv': Poetry) .venv/bin/python`` from the list

You also can run ``pytest`` without activating environment via Poetry, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run pytest

The tests for the core module are located in the ``./tests/partcad`` directory.
The tests for the CLI module are located in the ``./tests/partcad_cli`` directory.
The tests for the IDE viewer client are located in the ``./tests/partcad_ide_client`` directory.
The tests for the LSP server of VSCode plugin are located in the ``./ide/vscode/src/test/python_tests`` directory.

**The first run is slow, and that is the sandboxes rather than the tests.** A test whose part is scripted
(build123d, CadQuery, SDF, OpenSCAD) runs in a Python environment PartCAD provisions on first use -- a fresh
interpreter plus a pip install of the CAD stack -- and whichever test is the first to need a given one pays for
building it. Once built they are cached under ``~/.partcad`` and reused, so the same suite that took half an
hour cold takes minutes warm. The ``pytest`` ``pre-commit`` hook allows 15 minutes per test for that reason
(``PC_PYTEST_TIMEOUT`` overrides it); a test reported as timing out on a cold cache is worth simply running
again before it is treated as a bug.

**A gate reads the session's verdict, not pytest's exit code.** The two disagree on Windows, in both
directions: pytest has exited ``0`` with a test having failed, and it exits ``127`` after a session in which
every test passed. So a caller that must not be wrong sets ``PYTEST_RESULT_MARKER`` to a path, and the
``pytest_sessionfinish`` hook in the repository's root ``conftest.py`` writes ``success`` there only when
pytest's *final* exit status is clean *and* it counted no failed tests, and ``failure`` otherwise -- a
collection error included, which pytest reports as exit status 2. "Final" is load-bearing: pytest's terminal
reporter can still raise the status after the inner session hooks have run (exceeding ``--max-warnings`` is
how), so the hook is the outermost wrapper and reads ``session.exitstatus`` rather than the status it was
handed. Both gates do this -- the ``pytest`` ``pre-commit`` hook and the ``Pytest`` job in CI -- and both fail
unless they read ``success``, so a run that never reaches the hook at all (a crash mid-suite, a runner that
goes away) writes no marker and fails too. Nothing is written unless that variable is set, so an ordinary
``poetry run pytest`` is unaffected.

Behave
^^^^^^

PartCAD uses ``behave`` for integration testing, where a part of the system is tested as a whole.

To run tests using ``behave``, execute the following command in an activated environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ behave

Feature definitions and step implementations are located in the ``./features`` directory.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The packages under ``./examples`` are documentation, and they are also a
regression test. Each one declares a ``render:`` section, and the images and
``README.md`` files that ``pc render`` produces from it are **checked in**. That
is deliberate: a change in how PartCAD renders then shows up as a diff in those
files, and whoever made the change gets to decide whether it is an improvement
or a regression before it reaches a reader of the README.

So if your change affects what a projection or a generated document looks like,
re-render the examples and commit the result along with it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd examples && pc render -r

Two things guard the invariant. The ``example-images`` ``pre-commit`` hook is
instant and checks only what is already on disk: every image an example's
``README.md`` points at has to exist and be checked in, and no ``.gitignore``
may hide one. It exists because the mistake that costs is asymmetric -- a
regenerated ``README.md`` is a tracked file and stages itself with ``git add
-u``, while the images beside it are new and untracked and do not. The
``Examples (PartCAD)`` CI job then renders everything and fails if the working
tree changed at all; that check runs on one cell of the matrix, because what is
checked in is one rendering.

Everything PartCAD implements itself can be a baseline, including the DXF --
which a CAD tool would otherwise stamp with the time it was written and a fresh
pair of GUIDs. The built-in DXF renderer writes fixed values for those instead,
and pins the order of the ``CLASSES`` section, which ezdxf otherwise derives
from a ``set`` and so emits differently per process. That is the
``reproducible`` parameter of the ``dxf`` file type, on by default; a drawing
that has to record when it was really written sets ``reproducible: false``, and
stops being diffable.

An implementation another package supplies is not PartCAD's to fix, and one of
them may well write a different file every time. Those files are named in the
CI check's ``UNSTABLE`` list, which is deliberately short: every entry is a file
nobody is watching any more, so it needs a reason there and the same reason
where a reader of that package will meet it. See ``examples/feature_render_custom``,
whose SVG and PDF are the only entries today.

Coverage
^^^^^^^^

Every suite above measures coverage, and no one of those measurements means much on its own: the ``Pytest``
job never starts a CAD sandbox, ``Behave`` drives the installed ``pc`` and never imports a unit-test helper,
and the example sweeps walk success paths only. CI merges them. The ``Coverage`` job runs after every suite,
combines the raw ``.coverage`` data each one uploaded, and publishes the result three ways:

- the ``coverage-html-report`` artifact on the run -- download it, unpack it and open ``htmlcov/index.html``;
- **one comment** on the pull request, edited in place on every push, with the project rate, the patch rate and
  the changed statements nothing exercised;
- the ``Coverage`` check itself, which is the only thing here that can fail your pull request.

This replaced Codecov, and there is no third-party service in it any more. The merge is
``coverage combine`` over the data files, which is a **union of line numbers**, not an average of percentages:
a line ``Behave`` hit on Windows and ``Pytest`` missed on Linux is covered once. What lets it see those as one
file is the ``[paths]`` section of ``dev-tools/coverage.rc``, which maps the three roots the same file is
recorded under -- the checkout, ``site-packages``, and either of those with Windows separators -- onto one.

**The requirement is a floor under patch coverage.** "Patch" is the statements your pull request added or
changed, and the floor is the project's own statement coverage *in the same run*: cover what you write at
least as well as this repository is already covered. Nothing is stored between runs and nothing is compared
against history, so there is no baseline to maintain and no way for the bar to drift. A change that touches no
statement coverage measures -- documentation, workflows, a test -- has no patch to hold to it and passes with
a notice saying so.

Lines that are not statements are in neither half of that fraction: a comment, a blank line, or a file the
``include`` list in ``dev-tools/coverage.rc`` does not name. The figure answers "is the new code exercised",
not "how much did you type".

Every suite measures through the same ``dev-tools/coverage.rc``, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy:
it sets ``branch = True``, and ``coverage combine`` will not mix branch data with statement-only data. The
suites that drive ``coverage run`` pass the file on the command line; ``pytest`` measures through pytest-cov,
which finds no configuration on its own here, so ``addopts`` names ``--cov-config=dev-tools/coverage.rc``.
Drop that and the merge does not degrade, it fails outright.

A file **no job imported at all** does count, and it takes a step to make it. coverage.py reports the files it
saw, so a module nothing exercises is absent from the merged data rather than zero in it -- which would be a
hole in precisely the shape of the change worth catching, since a brand-new untested module would contribute
no statements at all and the requirement would find nothing to hold. The merge therefore walks the packages in
scope and records every file it did not find, at nought percent, before writing any report. This is also why
the project rate here is lower than the one Codecov used to show: it was never that high.

To see the same numbers locally, run whichever suites your change touches and then merge what they wrote:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run coverage run --rcfile=dev-tools/coverage.rc --data-file=.coverage.pytest -m pytest tests
    $ poetry run python dev-tools/ci/coverage_report.py merge --data-dir . --diff-base origin/devel
    $ poetry run python dev-tools/ci/coverage_report.py render --summary coverage-report/summary.json
    $ open coverage-report/htmlcov/index.html

Two notes on the comment. It is posted by the run itself, so on a pull request **from a fork** it does not
appear: GitHub gives such a run a read-only token, on purpose, and no setting here changes that. The report is
in the ``Coverage`` job's summary instead, and the requirement still gates. And ``CI-Dev`` measures coverage
too but does not feed this report -- a ``needs:`` does not reach across workflows, so there is no moment at
which ``CI`` knows that run has finished. Its suites are the same suites run in the dev container; it keeps
publishing its own ``coverage.xml`` inside its test-results artifact.

Commit & Push Changes
---------------------

You can commit changes from either terminal or VS Code UI which will trigger local git hooks managed by ``pre-commit`` to
enforce coding standards and catch some of the problems early.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    `pre-commit`_ is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.

Configuration file is located at ``.devcontainer/.pre-commit-config.yaml`` where you can see all supported hooks.

In rare cases, you might need to temporarily disable hooks. There are two options:

1. Use `temporarily disable hooks`_ to skip specific individual hooks
2. Use `git commit --no-verify`_ to skip all hooks at once

Remember: These hooks are required to pass in CI before PR merge.

.. warning::

    While you can remove local git hooks completely, be aware that:
    1. Your PR will be blocked from merging until all hook checks pass in CI
    2. You'll miss early feedback that could prevent CI failures
    3. You may need to make additional commits to fix issues that hooks would have caught locally

    Option 1: Using pre-commit (recommended)

    .. code-block:: bash

      # To remove hooks:
      pre-commit uninstall --config .devcontainer/.pre-commit-config.yaml
      # To restore hooks later:
      pre-commit install --config .devcontainer/.pre-commit-config.yaml

    Option 2: Manual removal (use with caution):

    .. code-block:: bash

      # Make sure you're in the right directory first
      if [ -d ".git/hooks" ]; then
        # Backup hooks first
        mkdir -p .git/hooks_backup
        mv .git/hooks/* .git/hooks_backup/
        echo "Hooks backed up to .git/hooks_backup/"
      else
        echo "Error: .git/hooks directory not found"
      fi

Open Pull Request
-----------------

There are multiple options how PR could be opened, please refer to the following to choose option which works best for
you.

- `Creating a pull request`_
- `GitHub Pull Requests in Visual Studio Code`_

Meet PR Merge Criteria
----------------------

Depending on files changed in PR you might need to get required checks to pass first and get reviews from owners or
maintainers, following are related GH docs:

- `About Status Checks`_
- `Required reviews`_

.. _deep-test:

How much CI a change runs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two questions decide it, and they are asked separately: **how deep** the matrix goes, and **which jobs** the
change can say anything about at all.

Depth: three tiers


CI fans out over operating systems, and a pull request does not pay for all of them.

``pr``
    What a pull request runs on every push to it. The oldest and the newest supported Python, with nothing
    in between, and every image except macOS -- whose runners bill at ten times the Linux rate, and which no
    standalone bundle or IDE is built for here either. **Both Windows images stay.** Windows is not a second
    macOS to economise on: its path separator, drive letters and line endings are a standing source of
    breakage in code written on Linux, so it is the platform a pull request most needs.

``queue``
    What the merge queue runs, which is what a pull request used to: every current image, macOS included, and
    the full Python range. Nothing reaches ``devel`` without having passed this, so the coverage a pull request
    drops is coverage the commit still has to earn -- one run per merge instead of one per push.

``deep``
    Everything, the older OS versions included: the nightly schedule, a manual workflow run, and any push,
    which includes the release. On a pull request, put ``#deepTest`` anywhere in the title or the description
    and re-run the checks. Worth doing when the change touches packaging, dependencies, the standalone bundle
    or the snap, or anything else where an older OS version could behave differently. It runs exactly what it
    always ran -- it is unaffected by everything on this page.

    .. note::

       The marker is matched as a plain substring, so a pull request that merely *mentions* it -- one editing
       this page, say -- opts itself in and runs the full matrix. That is deliberate: a matcher clever enough
       to tell a marker from a mention is a rule you would have to know before your opt-in worked, and
       over-running is the safe direction. If a description has to name the marker without asking for it,
       write it split across two code spans.

.. _Running CI in your own fork:

Running CI in your own fork
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A pull request **against this repository whose branch lives in your fork** runs with a read-only token and no
repository secrets. That is GitHub's rule, not a setting either side can change, and it holds whether or not you have
write access here -- what decides it is that the head is somewhere else. Most of CI does not care: the tests, the
linters, the extension and the bundles all run on a fork exactly as they run here.

A pull request **inside your fork** -- branch to branch, both in your copy -- is a different thing and gets the full
run: a writable token, your own secrets, your own container images. Nothing is held back there, because nothing about
it is untrusted from your fork's point of view. That is the run to open when you want CI to behave exactly as it does
on a pull request here, and it is worth knowing that the test for it is the head being in *another* repository and not
the head repository being a fork of something -- the two differ for precisely this case, and reading the wrong one
used to leave a fork unable to test its own work.

One thing does. A change under ``tools/containers/`` (or a ``#images`` marker) means the run has to *build* PartCAD's
container images and push them somewhere its own test jobs can pull them from, and a fork's pull request cannot push
anywhere. Such a run falls back to the release's images, so the change you made to them goes untested -- which used to
be a ``::warning::`` somewhere inside a green run.

The ``Prerequisites`` job now says so before the run instead, and says where to go:

.. code-block:: text

   | Capability         | State            | Detail                                           |
   | packages: write    | unavailable here | read-only, because GitHub gives a fork's pull    |
   |                    |                  | request a read-only token                        |

.. note::

   That job asks the registry what it grants the token, and it treats the answer as confirmation only. A granted
   ``push`` proves the write works; a withheld one proves nothing, because ghcr answers ``pull`` and no ``push`` on
   ``partcad/partcad`` itself -- the repository that publishes every one of these images. So the job never stops a run
   over that answer. What it costs is the case it was added for: a fork whose **Workflow permissions** are read-only
   is not caught before its push, only at it.

**Run CI in your fork to get that coverage.** Push the branch to your fork and start *CI* from its **Actions** tab
with "Run workflow". There the token writes to ``ghcr.io/<you>/partcad-container-*``, the run builds your images, and
its test jobs pull what it built rather than upstream's -- ``PC_CONTAINER_IMAGE_OWNER`` is what redirects them,
beside the ``PC_CONTAINER_IMAGE_TAG`` that redirects the tag. Link the run on your pull request and a reviewer can see
it went green.

Two things a fork needs once, and ``Prerequisites`` fails with both if they are missing:

* **Actions enabled.** A fork's **Actions** tab starts with "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them".
* **Read and write workflow permissions**, under **Settings -> Actions -> General**. Nothing else: the
  ``ghcr.io/<you>/partcad-container-*`` package is created on the first push, and no secret of your own is needed.

Note that a fork's default branch is called ``devel`` too, and a push to it used to run a matrix in which every single
job was skipped -- the ``Version updated`` rule below is about *this* repository, where a bump follows every merge
within minutes, and a fork has no bump coming. It no longer applies to a fork.

``SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_RO`` is the other secret this repository holds, and what it is for is a dependency that is not
public. These suites drive ``pc install``, and a PartCAD package may declare a ``git`` dependency on any repository --
so a **private** fork testing its own packages clones its own private repositories in CI, and this is the credential
that lets it. The public upstream needs none: its own dependencies are public and clone over https.

So ``Prerequisites`` asks for it where the repository is private and reports it as *not needed* where it is public, and
the behave jobs start no agent where there is no key -- unconditional, the agent action is handed an empty string and
fails the whole job with "The ssh-private-key argument is empty". The privacy of the repository is a heuristic for
"its dependencies are private too", not a fact: if your fork is private but everything it installs is public, set
``needs-ssh: "false"`` on the ``Prerequisites`` job in your copy of ``test.yml`` and ``test-dev.yml``.

A push to ``devel`` **in this repository** is the exception to all three: it runs no matrix at all unless its head
commit message starts with ``Version updated``, which is the release commit. (A fork is exempt -- see `Running CI in
your own fork`_ above. The reasoning below is about the bump that follows every merge here, and a fork has no bump
coming, so the rule would leave it with a run in which every job is skipped.) Every push to ``devel`` is followed by one of those within minutes
and it carries the same tree, so what a merge costs is one build of that tree rather than two -- and the artifacts it
produces are stamped with the version they will be released under rather than with the one the merge replaced.
``Standalone`` and ``IDE`` are gated on this too; they used to run on the merge as well, which is where the second
build and the stale version number came from. Neither has a ``paths:`` filter on its push trigger any more: the gate
is what decides, and a filter in front of it could only ever hide it -- a version bump happens to touch
``pyproject.toml`` and ``ide/vscode/package.json`` today, and the day ``dev-tools/bumpversion.toml`` stops naming such
a file nothing would be built on ``devel`` again with nothing to say so.

That exception applies to pushes and to nothing else -- the nightly run has no head commit to read a message from, so
the guard leads with the event name and lets every other trigger through. It did not, from the day the guard was
written until 0.8.32, and the nightly was skipped every night in between: if you change that condition, keep the
event-name clause first. The two workflows that can also be *called* -- ``Standalone`` and ``IDE``, both of which
``Deployment`` calls to build what a release carries -- lead with their ``inputs`` marker before that, because inside
a called workflow the whole ``github`` context is the caller's and there is no other way to recognise one.

The ``Standalone`` workflow reads the same tiers, job by job:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 26 26 26

   * - Job
     - ``pr``
     - ``queue``
     - ``deep``
   * - ``Build``
     - 3 bundles (no macOS)
     - 4 bundles
     - all 7
   * - ``Install``
     - 2 (every bundle ``install.sh`` can install)
     - 4 (adds the macOS bundle on the *next* macOS)
     - 8
   * - ``Snap``
     - 1 (amd64)
     - not run
     - 2, on a ``devel`` push or a dispatch
   * - ``Examples via bundle``
     - 2 (the ``PartCAD`` suite only)
     - not run
     - 6

``Snap`` and ``Examples`` have always been skipped in the merge queue and on the release path -- nothing
downstream consumes a snap, and the deterministic ``Build`` and ``Install`` jobs are what gate a release. What
is new is that a pull request packs one snap rather than two (the recipe is one file and the two jobs run it
over payloads ``Build`` and ``Install`` have already exercised, at ~45 minutes of squashing each), and that the
``All`` example suite -- ``continue-on-error``, because the public index carries packages this repository
cannot fix -- is left to deep runs.

The ``IDE`` workflow follows the same tiers, because each IDE carries a bundle: no macOS IDE on a pull request,
the Intel macOS one on a deep run only. A release always builds all seven bundles and all four IDEs, and
refuses to publish if any is missing.

Scope: what the change touches


Depth decides how wide a job fans out. Scope decides whether it runs at all, and it applies to the merge queue
exactly as it does to a pull request. ``.github/actions/changed-scopes`` sorts the changed files into buckets
and turns each subject on or off:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - A change touching only...
     - runs
   * - ``docs/``, ``.claude/``, ``openspec/``, and any ``*.md`` or ``*.rst`` no row below claims
     - ``Documentation``
   * - ``ai-agents/``, ``.claude-plugin/``
     - ``Claude Code plugin``
   * - ``ai-agents/common/``, ``ai-agents/claude/.claude-plugin/``
     - ``Claude Code plugin``, **and** the tests and the wheel -- the wheel ships the skills too
   * - ``.devcontainer/``
     - the ``CI-Dev`` container, ``Run: behave`` and ``Run: pc`` -- but not ``Run: pytest``
   * - ``ide/vscode/``, ``ide/vscode-shim/``
     - ``npm test``, ``VS Code extension``, ``IDE``
   * - ``ide/standalone/``, ``.vscode/``
     - ``IDE``
   * - ``dev-tools/pyinstaller/``, ``dev-tools/snap/``, ``.snapcraft.yaml``, ``install.sh``
     - ``Standalone``, ``IDE``
   * - ``pyproject.toml``, ``poetry.lock``, root ``requirements*``
     - the tests, the wheel **and** ``Standalone``
   * - ``tools/containers/``
     - the tests and the wheel, **and** a rebuild of PartCAD's own container images -- see below
   * - ``src/``, ``tests/``, ``features/``, ``examples/``, ``cad/``, ``tools/``, ``dev-tools/``
     - the tests and the wheel, but **not** ``Standalone``
   * - anything else
     - all of the above, ``Standalone`` included
   * - ``.github/``
     - everything, this being the thing that decides what runs

**The table above is grouped by subject, for reading. The classifier is an ordered list of rules and the first
one that matches a path wins**, and the two orders are not the same -- ``.github/`` is the last row here and
the first rule there. What matters is the shape of that list: every rule that names a *directory* comes before
every rule that matches by *extension*.

So a Markdown file belongs to whatever directory claims it first. ``ai-agents/common/skills/render/SKILL.md``
is the plugin -- and, since ``src/partcad/ai_agents`` symlinks it into the wheel, the wheel -- rather than prose
about either, and ``examples/feature_render/README.md`` is what ``pc render -r`` wrote and
what the ``Examples (PartCAD)`` job compares against a fresh render; neither is documentation.

``AGENTS.md`` and ``CLAUDE.md`` are matched ahead of the *source* directories, which is why
``src/partcad/AGENTS.md`` is documentation -- this repository keeps a package's own beside its code. They are
not matched ahead of the directories above those, so they are **not** documentation wherever they sit:
``.github/AGENTS.md`` is CI, ``ai-agents/AGENTS.md`` is the plugin, and ``ide/vscode/AGENTS.md`` belongs to the
extension. If you are adding a rule, its position in that list is the decision; ``.github/actions/changed-scopes``
carries the list in order, and ``tests/dev_tools/test_changed_scopes.py`` pins these cases.

Two of those rows are the same distinction from either side, and it is the only place a source change and a
dependency change are treated differently. Freezing is the most expensive thing this repository does -- ~500MB
of OpenCASCADE per runner -- and what makes a frozen bundle differ from a working wheel is nearly always what
went *into* it: a dependency shipping a data file PyInstaller cannot see, a new transitive import, a wheel with
no build for one platform. So a dependency change freezes and a change to ``src/`` alone does not.

That is a trade rather than a fact. A source change *can* break the freeze -- a lazily imported module, a file
read relative to ``__file__``; ``dev-tools/pyinstaller/README.md`` has the list -- and that is now found on
``devel`` after the merge rather than on the pull request. Specifically on the version bump that follows the
merge, which is the same tree with a version on it and the commit a release is cut from; a release still
refuses to publish with a platform missing, and ``#deepTest`` still builds the whole set before a merge for a
change that warrants it. Note also which way the last row falls: an unclassified path counts as **both**
source and dependency, so a bundle is skipped only for a directory somebody has named as source.

Two properties are worth knowing before you edit that list. It is **fail-safe**: a path it has not been taught
counts as both source and a dependency, so it runs everything a source change runs, the standalone bundles
included, and a new directory can only ever run too much. It does not turn on the four subjects that only their
own directory turns on -- the documentation, the extension, the IDE, the plugin -- and that is not a gap: each
is built from one fixed directory, so a path outside them cannot change what they contain. And it is a job
condition rather than a ``paths:`` filter on the trigger, deliberately -- ``merge_group`` supports no ``paths:``
filter at all, so a trigger-level list is one the merge queue ignores; and a workflow skipped by ``paths:``
never creates the check run that a *required* check waits for, while a job skipped by a condition reports
``skipped``, which counts as passing.

``.devcontainer`` is the one entry that is a judgement rather than a mechanism. ``Run: pytest`` in ``CI-Dev``
is the ``Pytest`` matrix over again on one image and one interpreter, and a change to the container's
configuration cannot make the unit tests disagree with what that matrix already said. What it can break is
whether anything works inside the container at all, and ``Run: behave`` and ``Run: pc`` -- which drive the
command line end to end, in the container -- are the jobs that ask that.

Both workflows install each macOS artifact on macOS 15 *and* on macOS 26, because there is one macOS build per
architecture and it is frozen on the older release -- so "a bundle runs on the OS it was built on and
everything newer" stopped being an assumption and became something a job checks. Only the Intel half of that
is deep-only.

The Python axis is not the same for every job, because not every job is testing the same thing. ``Pytest`` and
``Examples (All)`` run the whole supported range: they exercise PartCAD's own code, so the interpreter it runs
on is the point. ``Examples (PartCAD)`` and ``Repo //pub`` render packages, so what they are really testing is
the sandbox -- and a sandbox is built at the version PartCAD pins rather than at the version PartCAD is running
on, so they run the two ends of the range a sandbox can be built at instead
(``sandbox_versions.MIN_PYTHON_VERSION_CADQUERY`` and ``MAX_PYTHON_VERSION_CAD``). ``Behave`` drives the command
line, so it stays on the oldest and newest supported Python.

Testing a change to a container image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PartCAD ships container images of its own: the Python sandbox base images the ``docker`` sandbox renders in,
and the KiCad sandbox ``pc open --with kicad`` and ``test_part_example_kicad`` start. Every one of them is
addressed by the release that built it -- ``<name>:<release>``, plus the architecture suffix where there is
one -- and that tag is written by exactly one run: the version bump on ``devel``.

That leaves a gap on a pull request, and it is not a small one. A run that *changes* ``tools/containers``
builds those images as a test, but its tests go on pulling the tag the last release published -- so a
Dockerfile fix cannot be proven in the pull request that makes it, and a Dockerfile regression cannot be
caught there at all. That is how ``tools/containers/python/Dockerfile`` came to carry the ``pycairo`` wheel
reportlab needs while every PNG in every rendering job went on failing: the fix was in the repository and not
in the tag, and no run could tell.

So a run that changes an image builds and publishes ``<release>-<branch>-<digest>-<commit>`` instead, and points its own
tests at it. The commit is in the name because a branch is not unique in time: two pushes to one branch are two
runs, and each has to own the tag it builds, tests and deletes. Nothing but that run ever asks for that tag, which is what makes publishing it from an unreviewed branch
safe -- the release tag, the one somebody else pulls, is still only ever written by the bump. The run exports
``PC_CONTAINER_IMAGE_TAG`` to every job that runs a test, and ``partcad_utils.container_image.image_tag`` reads
it: unset, which is every installed PartCAD, it is the release.

Two things turn it on:

* A change under ``tools/containers/`` does, by itself. That is the row in the table above.
* ``#images`` anywhere in the pull request's title or description does, for a change the paths cannot see --
  a workflow edit, a base image that moved under an unpinned tag, a dependency that changes what gets
  installed into the image. It is matched as a plain substring, exactly like ``#deepTest``, with the same
  consequence: a pull request that merely mentions it opts itself in.

What the switch turns on is not the build. ``Build Docker Containers`` is gated on the union of the
``pytest``, ``behave`` and ``examples`` gates *and* on this run having a tag of its own, so it runs on any
run whose tests could reach a container -- and a pull request that fires neither trigger builds these images
for ``linux/amd64`` as a test, exactly as it did before any of this, and renders against the release's. That
fourth condition is what stops ``#images`` meaning nothing on a change that runs no tests at all: a
documentation-only pull request that opts in still builds and publishes, rather than opting into a build the
other three gates would then skip. What firing a trigger adds is the
``linux/arm64`` half, which goes through QEMU and costs minutes per version; publishing the result; pointing
that run's own tests at it through ``PC_CONTAINER_IMAGE_TAG``; and deleting it afterwards. Worth paying where
an image changed, worth nothing where none did, which is the whole reason for a switch.

From a **fork** the trigger fires and cannot finish, and the run says so in a ``::warning::``. A fork's
``GITHUB_TOKEN`` is read-only however the workflow declares its permissions, so nothing there can publish --
and a tag claimed but not published is every test job failing to pull an image that was never there, which is
worse than the gap it was meant to close. So such a pull request falls back to what every pull request did
before any of this: it builds the images as a test and runs against the release's. If you are changing one of
these images from a fork, expect a maintainer to re-run the change from a branch of this repository before it
lands.

These tags are cleaned up, in two places. ``CI`` deletes the Python sandbox tags it published once its own
test jobs have finished -- it is their only consumer, the dev container being unable to use the ``docker``
sandbox at all -- and ``Prune container images`` sweeps nightly for anything left: the KiCad tag, which ``CI``
cannot delete because ``CI-Dev`` reads it too and a ``needs:`` does not reach across a workflow; whatever a
cancelled run abandoned; and the ``partcad-devcontainer`` tags, which ``CI-Dev`` has been publishing on every
non-bump run since long before any of this and which nothing has ever removed. The sweep deletes a tag only
when it looks like ``<release>-<something that is not py<N>>`` *and* the version is a month old, so the release
tags, the ``<release>-py<N>-<arch>`` images and the moving ``py<N>-<arch>`` tags are all out of its reach by
construction. Run it by hand with ``dry-run`` to see what it would take.

One detail is worth knowing if you are reading the workflows: the tag goes *on* the image and the release goes
*into* it. A ``<release>-<branch>-<digest>-<commit>`` image still installs the release, because what it is built to test is this
commit's Dockerfile. ``.github/actions/container-images`` is where all of this is decided, once, for both
``CI`` and ``CI-Dev`` -- they hand the same answer to the same ``Container (KiCad)`` build, which could not be
told two different tags to build one image under.

A test job does not build these images. It pulls what ``Build Docker Containers`` built, which is why every
job that can reach a container waits for that one. ``.github/actions/sandbox-image`` used to build a copy per
job, because on a pull request the published tag was somebody else's build and nothing could tell whether this
commit had changed the Dockerfile -- and that is the question the ``images`` gate above now answers for the
whole run. What is left in the action is a pull, plus a build for the one caller with no such job to wait for:
``Examples via bundle`` in ``Standalone``, which runs on the version bump in a different workflow from the one
publishing that release's images. That build is not a second implementation either -- both it and
``Build Docker Containers`` run ``dev-tools/ci/build-sandbox-image.sh``, so there is one answer to "how is this
image built" and the two cannot drift into testing an image built differently from the one that was published.
Changing that script counts as a container change, like changing a Dockerfile.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The following information is useful for PartCAD contributors.

.. _location:

Coordinates / Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PartCAD uses OpenCASCADE Location objects (TopLoc_Location) to represent locations of objects in 3D space.

.. code-block:: javascript

    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 70]

The above list represents a location with the following components:

1. ``[1, 2, 3]``: Translation or offset (in millimeters) along the X, Y, and Z axes
2. ``[4, 5, 6]``: The X, Y and Z sizes of the vector to rotate around
3. ``70``: The angle of rotation around the above vector


Internal geometry representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PartCAD maintains parts as OpenCASCADE objects. Similar to ``wrapped`` objects found
in ``CadQuery`` and ``build123d``.

Parallelism
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Asynchronous at heart

  PartCAD is designed to run most of its logic as coroutines in the asyncio's event loop.

2. Threads for the muscle

  There is a separate thread pool created for long-running procedures that are CPU intensive.
  The number of threads matches the number of CPU cores minus 1 (if there is more than 1).

  Coroutines can spawn tasks on the thread pool. Tasks on the thread pool can't call coroutines that use asyncio.Lock().

3. Digest external code properly

  Separate processes are spawned (optionally, in a sandboxed environment) to process third-party CAD-as-code parts and assemblies.
  One thread is consumed in the thread pool to wait for each such process to complete (to cap the number of CPU cores occupied).

4. Friendly face

  To make it apparent to external users, all externally visible coroutines have names that end with "_async".
  Each such coroutine is accompanied by a synchronous wrapper (which does not have "_async" in its name).
