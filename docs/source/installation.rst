Command line tools
==================

PartCAD command line tools are implemented in Python and, in theory,
available on all platforms where Python is available. However, it is only
getting tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

  .. code-block:: shell

    $ python -m pip install -U partcad-cli

The commands and options supported by PartCAD CLI:

  .. code-block:: shell

    $ pc help
    usage: pc [-h] [-v] [--no-ansi] [-p CONFIG_PATH] {add,add-part,add-assembly,init,info,install,update,list,list-all,list-parts,list-assemblies,render,inspect,status} ...

=============
Python module
=============

PartCAD provides Python modules that can be used in CAD as code scripts
(such as CadQuery and build123d). It is a dependency for `partcad-cli` so it
doesn't usually need to be installed separately.

  .. code-block:: shell

      $ python -m pip install -U partcad
      $ python
      ...
      >>> import partcad as pc
      >>> ctx = pc.init()

============================
Visual Studio Code extension
============================

This extension is available through the VS Code marketplace.
The corresponding marketplace page is `here <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OpenVMP.partcad>`_.

=========================
Public PartCAD repository
=========================

The public PartCAD repository is hosted at `GitHub <https://github.com/openvmp/partcad-index>`_.
If necessary, PartCAD tools are automatically retrieving the contents of this
repository and all other required repositories and packages. No manual action is needed is need to `install` it.

However, if you suspect that something is wrong with locally cached files,
use ``pc status`` to investigate and to determine the location of the cached files.
