"""The merged coverage report, and the three things about it that fail silently.

`dev-tools/ci/coverage_report.py` replaced Codecov: the "Coverage" job in
`test.yml` merges every job's raw `.coverage` data, publishes the HTML report as
an artifact, edits one comment on the pull request and holds patch coverage to a
floor. Almost all of that announces itself when it breaks -- a missing artifact,
a step that exits non-zero, a comment that does not appear.

Three parts do not, and they are what these tests are about:

  * **The `[paths]` mapping in `dev-tools/coverage.rc`.** It is what makes the
    merge a union rather than a pile: the same file is recorded under three
    roots (the checkout, `site-packages`, and either of those with Windows
    separators), and without the mapping `coverage combine` keeps all three as
    separate files. The report is then produced, uploaded and commented on, and
    every rate in it is wrong -- lower than the truth, by however much the
    suites overlap. Nothing errors.

  * **The requirement.** It is a floor under the statements the pull request
    touched, set to the project's own statement rate in the same run. Get the
    arithmetic or the "nothing to measure" cases wrong and the gate passes
    everything, which looks exactly like a repository whose patches are all well
    covered.

  * **The contract between a test job and the merge**, which is a string: a job
    uploads its data as `coverage-data-<name>` and the merge downloads
    `coverage-data-*`. A job that stops matching that prefix drops out of the
    merged report and the report still renders.
