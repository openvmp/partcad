"""The tag CI builds PartCAD's own container images under, end to end.

Two facts have to agree, and nothing in a failing run says which of them moved.
A job builds `ghcr.io/partcad/partcad-container-*:<something>`, and a test in
some later job resolves a name through `partcad_utils.container_image.image_tag`
and pulls it. Where those two disagree the symptom is
`APIError: ... ("manifest unknown")`, hours in, or -- far worse -- a green run
that tested the *release's* images while claiming to have tested the ones this
commit changed.

So the tag is decided once, by `.github/actions/container-images`, and threaded:
into `container-kicad.yml` as an input, into the Python sandbox build as an
environment variable, and into every job that runs a test as
`PC_CONTAINER_IMAGE_TAG`, which is what `image_tag` reads. This file runs that
action's script over the three cases it distinguishes, and then checks that each
end of the wire is attached -- because a wire with one end loose is exactly the
green run above.

The library half of the same subject is `tests/partcad_utils/test_container_image.py`.
