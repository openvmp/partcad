"""No test starts before every container it might run in has been published.

`tests/partcad/unit/test_part.py::test_part_example_kicad` starts
`ghcr.io/partcad/partcad-container-kicad:<release>` -- the release PartCAD
itself reports, see `part_factory_kicad.get_runtime`. Nothing in that test, or
in the workflow that runs it, says where the image comes from: it is published
by a CI job, and a commit that bumps the version is the first and only commit
for which that tag has never existed.

So the two workflows that run that test have to *wait* for the job that
publishes it, and neither can wait on a job in the other file -- `needs:` does
not reach across a workflow. What makes that possible is that the build lives in
a reusable workflow both of them call. Lose the call from either one and the
failure is not a missing job: it is `APIError: ... ("manifest unknown")` from a
test whose whole purpose is to fail when the KiCad path is broken, hours into a
run, on the version bump and nowhere else.

The rule the later half of this file pins is the general form of that: a test
job waits for every container it might run in, and a container's build is gated
no more narrowly than the jobs waiting for it. The second half is not a detail.
A job whose dependency is skipped is skipped rather than delayed, so a builder
gated on less than its dependents does not make them wait -- it deletes them,
and a suite that stops running is the one kind of CI failure nothing reports.
