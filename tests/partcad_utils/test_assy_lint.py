"""Tests for the YAML checker in ``partcad_utils.assy_lint``.

An ASSY file and a ``partcad.yaml`` are both Jinja2 templates, so the checker
cannot simply parse either as YAML. It masks the template first, which is what
lets it keep the source line and column of every finding -- and what forces it
to stay quiet about anything the mask made unknowable. Both halves are pinned
here: real errors are found at the right place, and templated files that are
perfectly correct stay clean.

Most of what follows uses ASSY files, because the two documents differ only in
which schema governs them; the block at the end covers what is specific to a
package configuration.
