"""Contract tests for the boundary between the `pc` CLI and the PartCAD daemon.

`pc` is a thin JSON-RPC client: a command body calls
``partcad_cli.click.service.run(cli_ctx, "<method>", ...)`` and the per-workspace
daemon does the work. Two rules hold that arrangement together, and both were
conventions that only broke at runtime -- or 30-60 minutes into the behave
matrix -- while the migration was in flight:

* every method name a command sends must exist in the daemon's registry, and
* a command may import the heavy ``partcad`` package only when it is one of the
  few that genuinely run in the client process.

The tests below turn both into pytest failures. They read the command tree with
:mod:`ast`: nothing here imports a command module or invokes a click command, so
they cost milliseconds and cannot be fooled by import side effects.

They live under `tests/partcad_cli` rather than next to the daemon because that
is where the command tree they read lives: `src/partcad_cli/click/commands`.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The command boundary.
#
# The rationale lives in src/partcad_cli/AGENTS.md, "Command boundary"; the short
# version is that a command belongs on the *daemon* when it reads or mutates the
# package graph or drives a CAD wrapper (whose sandboxed Python runtime lives in
# the daemon's environment and may not exist on the client at all), and stays
# *in-process* only when it works on client-only state that cannot cross the
# wire. A package-mutating command that runs in-process is worse than slow: the
# daemon's warm context keeps serving the pre-mutation package.
#
# These two dicts are the single place where the boundary is written down. Both
# map a path relative to COMMANDS_DIR to the reason it is listed, which is what
# the failure messages print. Adding a normal (thin) command needs no edit here.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# deliberate decision, not a leftover -- read the reason before adding one.
