"""Tests for `pc open`.

The command is a thin wrapper over `partcad_client.external`, and what is pinned
here is the wrapping: the options it hands over, and the two ways it reports
back. The JSON shape matters most -- the VS Code extension's "Open in..." menu
reads it, and on a failure the message it carries is the whole answer (which X
server to install, or how to let PartCAD use a container), so it has to survive
a non-zero exit rather than be replaced by one.

The one thing this command sends to the daemon is pinned here too, from both
sides: an application that reads meshes has to be handed one, and making a mesh
out of a solid is CAD work -- but *only* that. A `pc open` that needed no
conversion and connected anyway would start a daemon to open a file that was
already on disk, on a machine that may have neither a CAD environment nor any
use for one, and would fail where it used to work. Which method is sent, on
what, and that nothing is sent otherwise, is the whole contract; that a daemon
call is allowed here at all is `test_command_boundary.py`'s to say.

Which side of the command boundary this command is on is checked by
`test_command_boundary.py`; nothing here starts an application or a container.
