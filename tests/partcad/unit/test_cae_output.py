"""Unit tests for the `cae:` section: how an analysis picks its implementation.

`cae:` is an output section of the same shape as `export:` and `render:` and is
resolved by the same code, which is the point of it - and also the risk. Two
things have to stay true and are what is checked here:

* a `cae:` file type is **not** an output format. `pc render -t fea` must not
  find it, and it must not fall back to a render implementation.
* the implementation comes from the user configuration by default, is named as
  `<package>:<file type>`, and the file it writes is named after the analysis as
  well as the object - `bracket.fea.vtu`, because a part has as many results as
  it has analyses.

No solver and no sandbox: everything here stops at the point where the script
would be run.
