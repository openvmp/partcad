"""What a STEP file says about how precisely it has to be made.

'tolerance_inspect' reads ISO 10303-21 as text, without a CAD kernel, for the
two things in it that state a manufacturing tolerance: the bounds of a
plus/minus tolerance on a dimension, and the magnitude of a geometric tolerance.
What it must not read is the 'UNCERTAINTY_MEASURE_WITH_UNIT' every STEP file
carries, which is the precision the geometry was written to and not a tolerance
anybody is being held to.

A file that states several tolerances that are not the same has no single
tolerance, and that is reported as NaN rather than by picking one of them.
