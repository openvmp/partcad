"""Unit tests for the `cam:` section: how a route picks its implementation.

`cam:` is an output section of the same shape as `export:` and `render:` and is
resolved by the same code, which is the point of it - and also the risk. What is
checked here is that it stays its own section and resolves the way it says it
does:

* a `cam:` file type is **not** an output format. `pc render -t gcode` must not
  find it, and it must not fall back to a render implementation.
* unlike `cae:`, it has a built-in package, and the shipped default names it.
* the implementation comes from the user configuration by default, is named as
  `<package>:<file type>`, and the file it writes is named after the object
  alone - `panel.nc`, because an object has one route at a time.

No machine and no sandbox: everything here stops at the point where the script
would be run.
