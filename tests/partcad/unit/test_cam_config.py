"""Unit tests for the `cam:` section: what an object says about being cut.

`partcad.cam` reads a configuration and converts its units, and that is all it
does -- it imports no CAD library and touches no geometry, which is what lets it
be tested without a sandbox. The three things checked here are the three a wrong
answer would be discovered on a machine rather than in a diff:

* every spelling a length, a feed and a speed may be written in ends up as the
  same number, in millimetres and millimetres per minute;
* an object's `cam:` section takes a **closed** set of keys, so that a typo is a
  sentence rather than a route cut to a default;
* what an object did *not* declare stays absent, so that a package's own layer
  still answers for it.
