"""Reading a shape's topology off its BREP payload, and what the check does with it.

The point of 'partcad.brep_inspect' is that the core can answer "is this part a
body or a skin?" from the bytes it already holds - no CAD kernel, no sandbox, no
full parse of the payload. So this file imports no CAD library, and the fixtures
it reads are real 'BRepTools::Write' output checked in beside it (see
'data/brep/README.md').
