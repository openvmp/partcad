"""What the 'interference' and 'degenerate' checks decide, and on what.

The 'cad' test asks whether a shape was produced. These two ask whether what
was produced is a solid anybody meant, and whether the parts ended up anywhere
sensible - the questions an assembly is actually judged on, and the ones that
have needed a person looking at a render.

The geometry itself is exercised in the wrapper, which needs a CAD library and
so is not reachable from here; what is covered here is the deciding: which
verdict follows from which measurement, and what the configuration does.
