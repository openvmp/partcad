"""'pc test' asks for the same objects 'pc supply' would order.

The manufacturability test used to walk 'get_bom()', the flattened list of an
assembly's parts, so the parts of a sub-assembly that is sold assembled had to
be manufacturable by themselves -- something nobody buying that sub-assembly
would ever need. It walks the procurement BoM instead now, and verifies that a
purchasable assembly has a supplier, the way it always has for a part.
