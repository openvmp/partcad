"""A part is only manufacturable if the software it ships with holds up.

A board nobody can flash is not a board anybody can make, so the manufacturing
test asks the same question of a part's 'software:' that the bill of materials
leaves hanging: does the reference resolve, is the file there, and is it the one
that was meant. The fixture ('data/software_cam') is one board declared five
ways -- shipping nothing, shipping a file that checks out, shipping one whose
hash does not match, one that nothing identifies, and one that does not exist.
