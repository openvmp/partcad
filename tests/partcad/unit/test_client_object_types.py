"""The client's copy of PartCAD's object types, checked against the original.

`partcad_client.object_types` answers one question -- is this object already a
mesh? -- for `pc open`, in a process that must not `import partcad`: the client
is deliberately cheap, and a machine running `pc open` may have no CAD kernel on
it at all. So the type tables are inlined there, the way
`partcad_cli.click.commands.adhoc.convert.part` inlines the type lists it offers.

An inlined copy is only safe while something notices it drifting, and this is
that something. It fails by name when a part type is added to PartCAD and not
classified in the client, which matters more than it looks: an unclassified type
comes back as "not a mesh", which *works* -- the file is converted to STL and
Blender opens it -- so a new mesh format would silently take the slow, lossy
route and nothing would ever say so.

It lives here rather than beside the module it checks because this is the suite
that already has `partcad` in it; `tests/partcad_client` runs without one, and
that is worth keeping.
