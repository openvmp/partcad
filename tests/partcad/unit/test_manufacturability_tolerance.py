"""A part that is going to be made has to say how precisely.

'tolerance' is an object-type parameter of the homogeneous part types, and it
reads back as 0.0 when nothing declared one. 0.0 is a demand for perfect
precision, which is what "nobody said" amounts to and is not something a
manufacturer can be asked for, so the CAM test rejects it - for a part in the
package, and for a part an assembly in the package is procured from.

Only what is actually made is asked: a part that is bought comes as it comes.
