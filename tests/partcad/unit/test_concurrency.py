"""The admission gate that 'pc test' and 'pc lint' run behind.

Every case here is written against a wall clock, because what is being tested is
that something completes at all. A regression does not make these slow, it makes
them never return -- so each one is driven through 'asyncio.wait_for()' and a
timeout is the failure.
