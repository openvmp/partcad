"""A part that is made by bending a flat piece, and what has to be true of it.

'sheet_metal' is not described the way the other manufacturing methods are. It
is not a part made from stock: it is a *flat piece* - made by somebody else, and
already carrying the outline and the holes - put through a brake. So the
declaration names two things rather than describing one:

    manufacturing:
      method: sheet_metal
      source: blank                         # the part that is bent
      instructions: bends;include=BEND_UP   # the sketch that says where

and 'pc test' asks one question of each of them: the blank has to be flat on top
and bottom, and every bend line has to say what kind of bend it is.

The flatness analysis is exercised against real OCCT geometry here, because it
is geometry that it is about; the check that drives it is exercised with that
analysis and the sketch's annotations stubbed, because what it does with the
answers is not.
