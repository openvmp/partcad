"""Unit tests for the viewing angle of a 2D projection.

'pc render --view' is meant to be a naming of what 'partcad.yaml' already says,
not a second way of saying it: what a name resolves to has to be the very
'viewport_origin'/'viewport_up' pair a 'render:' file type is configured with,
and it has to reach the implementation on top of that configuration rather than
beside it. Both halves are checked here without a sandbox.
