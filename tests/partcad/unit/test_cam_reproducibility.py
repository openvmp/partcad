"""Manufacturing is repetition, so what is made has to be identified.

An object read from a file the package fetches rather than carries cannot
promise that the next run produces the same thing -- the URL is free to serve
something else tomorrow -- unless it says which bytes it expects. 'fileHash'
next to 'fileUrl' is that statement. It stays optional in the declaration, and
the manufacturing test is the one place it is insisted on.

A file a repository plugin serves is exempt for now: a 'fileHash' given for one
is verified like any other, it is simply not required yet.
