"""What a drawing says about its own elements, and how it survives the trip.

A DXF entity may carry XDATA - tags an application wrote against it, beside the
geometry - and that is where a sheet metal drawing says which line is a bend and
how far it goes. BREP has nowhere to put any of it, so it is read as the file is
imported ('wrappers/dxf_metadata.py') and carried beside the geometry from then
on, which is what makes it a property of the *sketch* rather than of the file:
the day another sketch type states the same thing, nothing that reads it changes.

Two halves are checked here, and they are the two the feature is made of:

* the reading - which spellings of XDATA are understood, which elements are
  reported, and what the layer filters do to the answer;
* the carrying - that the annotations are cached beside the geometry, and that a
  cache entry written before they existed is rebuilt rather than read back as a
  drawing that annotates nothing.

No CAD library and no sandbox: the reader needs ezdxf alone, and the caching is
exercised through 'Shape.get_wrapped' over a shape that builds nothing.
