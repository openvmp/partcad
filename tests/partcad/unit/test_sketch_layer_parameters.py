"""Which layers of a drawing a sketch reads is a parameter, not just a field.

A DXF holds the outline of a part and the lines its bends go along, on layers of
its own. Before this, which of them a sketch read was a field of the
declaration, so reading two of them meant declaring a second sketch - and a
third for the next combination somebody wanted.

They are object-type parameters now: 'include' and 'exclude' are contributed by
the 'dxf' type itself rather than invented by the author of the sketch, so they
exist whether or not the declaration mentions them, and whoever *refers* to the
sketch can set them: 'bends;include=BEND_UP,BEND_DOWN'. The top-level fields
stay exactly what they were, as the default the reference overrides.

Nothing here builds a sketch: what is checked is which layers the factory is
left holding, which is settled while the package is loaded.
