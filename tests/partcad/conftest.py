    A test that mocks the clone itself leaves the repository cache directory
    uncreated, so the guard file that ``project_factory_git`` writes beside the
    clone has nowhere to go and the write has to be mocked away.

    Patch the name in that module rather than ``builtins.open``: a global
    ``open()`` mock is also handed to the standard library, and the standard
    library opens files during ``pc.Context()`` on some platforms. On macOS
    ``Context.__init__`` computes the host tags, which reads the OS version out
    of ``/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist``; ``plistlib`` reads
    it in binary mode, so a mock handing back ``str`` fails there with
    ``TypeError: startswith first arg must be str or a tuple of str, not bytes``.
    That is invisible on Linux, so keep the mock where it belongs.

    ``create=True`` because ``open`` is a builtin: the module has no global of
    that name until this puts one there, which is exactly what makes the module
    find the mock while everyone else keeps the real thing.
