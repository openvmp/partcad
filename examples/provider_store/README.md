# /pub/examples/partcad/provider_store

Example of a shop provider implemented using a CSV file.

This examples demostrates how to implement a provider of the type 'store'.
While this example uses a file, the providers are expected to uses online
services for accessing up-to-date part availability data.
However the use of a static file is acceptable too: the most of customers
are expected to refresh the file every 24 hours (PartCAD's default
dependency update strategy).


## Usage
Find a provider to order 25 nuts from:
```shell
$ pc supply find --provider myGarage /pub/robotics/parts/gobilda:hardware/nut_m4_0_7mm#25
...
INFO:  The requested parts are available through the following suppliers:
INFO:  /pub/robotics/parts/gobilda:hardware/nut_m4_0_7mm#25:
		/pub/examples/partcad/provider_store:myGarage
...
```

Ask for too much (26 parts while the store has only 25 in stock) and find nothing:
```shell
$ pc supply find --provider myGarage /pub/robotics/parts/gobilda:hardware/nut_m4_0_7mm#26
...
ERROR: Provider /pub/examples/partcad/provider_store:myGarage cannot provide /pub/robotics/parts/gobilda:hardware/nut_m4_0_7mm.
...
```

Get a quote for a minimum order to get 1 part:
```shell
$ pc supply quote --provider myGarage /pub/robotics/parts/gobilda:hardware/nut_m4_0_7mm#1
...
INFO:  The following quotes are received:
INFO:  		/pub/examples/partcad/provider_store:myGarage: 123456: $0.01
INFO:  			/pub/robotics/parts/gobilda:hardware/nut_m4_0_7mm#1
...
```

Use the quote in a script:
```shell
$ pc -q supply quote --provider myGarage --json /pub/robotics/parts/gobilda:hardware/nut_m4_0_7mm#1 | jq '.[] | .result | .price' -
0.01
```

Make an order (assuming the cart id is '123456') before the quote expires:
```shell
$ pc supply order 123456
```
