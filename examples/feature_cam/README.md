# Route files: `pc cam`

`pc cam` writes the program a machine cuts an object with. It takes the object's
own outline, offsets it by the radius of the cutter, and cuts it at a series of
depths — a 2.5D route, which is what a CNC router does to sheet goods and what a
mill does to a plate.

```shell
pc cam
```

```
//pub/examples/partcad/feature_cam:nameplate: .../nameplate.nc
	engrave, 2 pass(es), 0.400 mm deep, 669.6 mm of cutting moves
//pub/examples/partcad/feature_cam:panel: .../panel.nc
	profile, 6 pass(es), 18.000 mm deep, 6434.5 mm of cutting moves
//pub/examples/partcad/feature_cam:tray_recess: .../tray_recess.nc
	pocket, 4 pass(es), 8.000 mm deep, 18428.9 mm of cutting moves
```

Three objects were routed. This package declares four.

## An object opts in by declaring `cam:`, and that is the whole of the opt-in

`pc cam` with nothing named produces a route for every sketch and part of the
package that declares a `cam:` section, and passes over every object that does
not — silently. `spacer` in `partcad.yaml` is here to be passed over: it is an
ordinary part, identical to `panel` but for the missing section, and a run over
this package neither routes it nor complains about it.

That silence is deliberate. Most objects are never cut, and a package where
three parts of forty are is the ordinary case rather than thirty-seven warnings.
What *is* an error is naming one:

```shell
pc cam :spacer
```

```
ERROR: ...:spacer declares no 'cam:' section, so there is nothing to route
```

— because naming an object is asking about that object, and coming back with
nothing would look exactly like a route that went somewhere you did not notice.

An assembly and a scene are not routed at all, and cannot be. An assembly is put
together rather than cut, and a scene is an arrangement of things that were each
cut on their own, so neither has an outline a machine could follow.

## The three operations

Each says which side of the outline the tool runs on.

| | object | operation | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `panel` | a 300 × 200 × 18 mm panel with two cable holes | `profile` | around the outside of the panel and the inside of each hole, so it survives at its nominal size |
| `tray_recess` | the 160 × 100 × 8 mm **void** of a tray | `pocket` | clears what is inside the outline, ring by ring |
| `nameplate` | a flat 120 × 40 mm sketch | `engrave` | follows the outline itself, offset by nothing |

**`profile` cuts the holes first.** A profile cut ends by separating the part
from its stock, and a hole cut after that is cut in something that is no longer
held. `panel.nc` starts at `X-93.000 Y0.000` — the cable hole at x = −100, with
a 6 mm cutter running 3 mm inside its 10 mm radius — and the panel's own outline
is the last thing in the file.

**`pocket` cuts the wall last**, for the opposite reason: the innermost ring
first means the finished wall is cut by a tool engaged on one side rather than
buried in a slot. `tray_recess.nc` starts at `X-31.200 Y1.200`, which is the
last ring that still has anything left of it, and works outward.

**`engrave` ignores the tool's diameter**, because a V-bit and a drag knife have
no radius to compensate for. It is the one operation whose path is the object's
own geometry.

## What is configured where

The tool, the depths and the feeds are one namespace with three layers, and the
narrower layer wins:

1. `//builtin/cam`, which PartCAD ships — a slow feed, a shallow pass, a
   generous clearance, and `direction: climb`.
2. this package's own `cam: gcode:` section, at the bottom of `partcad.yaml` —
   what this shop does: `feed: 2400 mm/min`, `safe_z: 8 mm`.

   `safe_z:` is a **clearance above the top of the object**, not an absolute
   height: the panel's top is at Z18, so its rapids are at `Z26.000` while the
   nameplate's — a sketch at Z0 — are at `Z8.000`.
3. the object's own `cam:` section — what is true of that object, and nothing
   else. `panel` names a tool and a spindle speed; `tray_recess` also names a
   shallower pass and a stepover, because it is clearing an area rather than
   following a line.

So a package cutting twenty parts from one sheet says `tool: 6 mm` once, and the
one part that needs a smaller cutter says so for itself.

**`tool:` has no default, and must not get one.** Every other parameter has a
defensible default; the diameter of the cutter is the one number that cannot be
guessed from the part, and a route produced against a diameter nobody chose is
wrong by exactly the amount nobody noticed. A request that reaches the
implementation without one is refused and says where to set it.

**Units are read, not assumed.** A length may be written `6`, `6 mm`, `0.25 in`
or `0.25"`, a feed `2400`, `2400 mm/min`, `40 mm/s` or `60 in/min`, a speed
`18000` or `18000 rpm`. A bare number is millimetres and millimetres per minute.
That conversion happens at every layer, so a `mm/min` written by the package is
understood as surely as one written on the object. What the *file* is written in
is a separate question, and the `units:` parameter of the `gcode` file type: a
part 18 mm thick is cut 18 mm deep whether the program says `G21` or `G20`.

`depth:` is the one key with a conditional default. A part that does not say is
cut **through** — from the top of its bounding box to the bottom, which for
`panel` is 18 mm in six 3 mm passes. A sketch has no thickness to be cut through,
so `nameplate` has to say how deep to score and is refused if it does not.

## What comes out

Plain RS-274, as a `.nc` file beside the package:

```gcode
(PartCAD route)
(object: //pub/examples/partcad/feature_cam:panel)
(operation: profile climb, tool 6.000, depth 18.000 in 6 passes)
(units: millimeters)
G21
G90
G17
G94
M3 S18000
G0 Z26.000
G0 X-93.000 Y0.000
G1 Z15.000 F600
G1 X-93.038 Y0.732 F2400
...
M5
M30
```

**Every curve is G1 moves, not G2/G3 arcs.** An arc word is only an arc while
the plane it was written in survives the post-processor, and the `tolerance:`
parameter (0.01 mm by default) is one number that says exactly what the
approximation costs. Two of them would say less.

**The file is byte-stable.** Nothing in it is a timestamp, a host name or a
version, so the same object and the same parameters produce the same bytes on
any machine — which is what makes a route something a repository can hold and a
reviewer can diff. They are not checked in *here* only because nothing in this
repository regenerates them: the examples job renders, it does not route, so a
committed `.nc` would be a file that silently stops matching the part it came
from. See `.gitignore`.

**A spindle nobody commands is one the operator set.** An object that names no
`speed:` gets no `M3`/`M5`, because a router with a manual dial is still the
common case.

## The limits, which are real

**The outline is a section taken at the bottom of the cut.** For a prismatic
object — a panel, a plate, a gasket, anything cut out of stock of one thickness
— that is the same outline at every depth and there is nothing more to say. For
an object whose cross-section changes over the cut there is no single right
answer: following the widest gouges nothing but leaves material, following the
narrowest cuts into the part. `pc cam` follows the bottom and **says so**:

```
WARNING: ...: the outline changes over the depth of the cut
         (<area> mm2 at the top, <area> mm2 at the bottom);
         this route follows the one at the bottom
```

No object in this package triggers it — all three are prismatic over their cut,
which is the case a 2.5D route is exactly right for. Give `panel.py` a draft
angle or a chamfered edge and the warning appears. That warning is the point of
it. A route produced from an outline you did not
expect is the one failure that looks like a success all the way to the machine.

**A pocket may not have an island.** Material in the middle of a pocket is
material the route would have to leave, and leaving it means knowing where the
rings must stop rather than where they run out. An outline with a hole in it is
refused rather than cut through — cut the island as a `profile` of its own.

**A hole smaller than the tool is refused** too, rather than skipped: there is no
path around the inside of it, and a hole silently missing from a route is worse
than a route that does not exist.

**There is no lead-in, no tab and no ramp.** The tool plunges straight down at
the start of each contour and the part is free at the end of the last pass. For
sheet goods that means fixturing or a sacrificial board, which is what you were
going to do anyway; for a part that must not move, cut it in two runs at
different depths.

**Nothing here knows about your machine.** The route is geometry, feeds and
depths; whether your controller wants this dialect is between you and it. A
controller that wants another is a package declaring a file type in its own
`cam:` section, and `camImplementation` — or `-i` — pointing at it.

## Running it

```shell
# every object of this package that declares a `cam:` section
pc cam

# one of them; `-s` when it is a sketch rather than a part
pc cam :panel
pc cam -s :nameplate

# this package and everything it imports
pc cam -r

# somewhere else, and in somebody else's dialect
pc cam -O /tmp :panel
pc cam -i //some/package:gcode :panel

# as data, for whatever comes next
pc --no-ansi cam --json :panel
```

`--json` prints what was produced — the file, the implementation that wrote it,
and whatever that implementation counted about the route:

```json
[
  {
    "object": "//pub/examples/partcad/feature_cam:panel",
    "implementation": "//builtin/cam:gcode",
    "filepath": ".../panel.nc",
    "extension": "nc",
    "stats": {
      "operation": "profile",
      "paths": 3,
      "passes": 6,
      "depth": 18.0,
      "cut_length": 6434.503735078836
    },
    "warnings": []
  }
]
```

`pc cam` exits non-zero if any object it was asked about produced no route, and
reports every one of them rather than stopping at the first: a route is a file,
and an object whose section is wrong must not cost the other nineteen theirs.

### One thing that will waste your time

**The route is produced in the daemon's environment, not your shell's.** With a
daemon already running, anything you set in the environment to steer a run is
silently ignored. `pc daemon stop` first. The same warning `feature_cae`'s
README gives, for the same reason.

## `pc test -f cam` is a different thing

`pc test`'s `cam` check — and the `cam-additive`, `cam-subtractive` and
`cam-forming` checks below it — ask whether an object *can* be manufactured or
purchased at all: whether the geometry suits the method it declares, whether
what it is made from is reproducible, whether a supplier could be found.
`pc cam` asks nothing and produces the program.

They share a word because they are both computer-aided manufacturing, and they
share nothing else. An object with a `cam:` section is not thereby checked, and
an object the check passes has no route unless it declares one.
