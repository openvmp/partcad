@cli @pc-open
Feature: `pc open` command

  Background: Create temporary $HOME and working directory
    Given I am in "/tmp/sandbox/behave" directory
    And I have temporary $HOME in "/tmp/sandbox/home"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: An unknown application is refused, and the known ones are named
    # Checked before anything is looked for, so this says the same thing on
    # every machine -- including one that has FreeCAD installed, where the
    # scenarios below must still not open a window.
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --with solidworks cube.step"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And OUTPUT should contain "Unknown application"
    And OUTPUT should contain "freecad"
    And OUTPUT should contain "gazebo"
    And OUTPUT should contain "kicad"
    And OUTPUT should contain "blender"
    And OUTPUT should contain "mujoco"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: A file that is not there is reported rather than opened
    Given a file named "cube.step" does not exist
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open cube.step"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And OUTPUT should contain "No such file"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: The reason survives --json, which the editor reads
    # A failure exits non-zero *and* prints the reason as JSON: the message is
    # the whole answer (what to install, how to allow a container), and the
    # VS Code extension's "Open in..." menu has nothing else to show the user.
    Given a file named "cube.step" does not exist
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --json cube.step"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And STDOUT should contain '"ok": false'
    And STDOUT should contain "No such file"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: A world file that is not there is reported rather than opened in Gazebo
    # The scene half of the "Open in..." menu: a '.world' file is what Gazebo
    # reads, and it is looked for on this machine exactly as a STEP file is.
    Given a file named "warehouse.world" does not exist
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --with gazebo warehouse.world"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And OUTPUT should contain "No such file"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: A model file that is not there is reported rather than opened in MuJoCo
    # The other simulator in the "Open in..." menu. MuJoCo reads MJCF, so an
    # '.xml' is handed over as it is and nothing is converted -- which means the
    # file itself is still the first thing that has to exist.
    Given a file named "stack.xml" does not exist
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --with mujoco stack.xml"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And OUTPUT should contain "No such file"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: A board that is not there is reported rather than opened in KiCad
    Given a file named "pcb.kicad_pro" does not exist
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --with kicad pcb.kicad_pro"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And OUTPUT should contain "No such file"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: A part that is not there is reported rather than opened in Blender
    Given a file named "cube.stl" does not exist
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --with blender cube.stl"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And OUTPUT should contain "No such file"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: The declared type is an option, and it is checked with the rest
    # The VS Code extension passes it for every object it opens; a `pc` that did
    # not accept it would fail as a usage error rather than for the reason here.
    Given a file named "cube.py" does not exist
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --with blender --type cadquery cube.py"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And OUTPUT should contain "No such file"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: A script whose type cannot be told from its name says what to pass
    # Blender reads meshes, so this file has to be converted -- and converting
    # it means running it, as one of the three kinds of script a '.py' can be.
    # Refused here, before a daemon is asked to guess, and no window is opened.
    # Read as JSON, which is one unwrapped line: the error panel `pc` draws
    # otherwise wraps to the terminal's width, and a message split across two
    # lines is not one a scenario can look for.
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --json --with blender $PARTCAD_ROOT/examples/produce_part_cadquery_primitive/cylinder.py"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And STDOUT should contain "--type"
    And STDOUT should contain "cadquery"

  @failure @pc-open
  Scenario: An ASSY file is refused by name rather than sent to be refused
    # There is no package around an ad-hoc file to resolve an ASSY against, so
    # `pc open` says so itself instead of asking the daemon to convert it.
    When I run "pc --no-ansi open --json --with blender $PARTCAD_ROOT/examples/produce_scene_assy/bench.assy"
    Then the command should exit with a non-zero status code
    And STDOUT should contain "only means anything inside a package"
    And STDOUT should contain "pc export"
