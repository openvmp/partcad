Feature: `pc convert part` command

  @stl @dry-run
  Scenario: Dry-run conversion for part `cube`
    When I run "pc convert part :cube -t step --dry-run"
    Then the command should exit with a status code of "0"

  @step @directory
  Scenario: Conversion with specified output directory for part `cube`
    Given a directory named "output" exists
    When I run "pc convert part :cube -t step -O output"
    Then the command should exit with a status code of "0"
    And STDOUT should contain "Converting 'cube': stl to step"
    And a file named "output/cube.step" should exist

  @error
  Scenario: Failure due to missing object argument
    When I run "pc convert part -t step"
    Then the command should exit with a status code of "2"

  @error
  Scenario: Failure due to non-existent object
    When I run "pc convert part :nonexistent -t brep"
    Then the command should exit with a status code of "2"

  @error
  Scenario: Conversion failure due to unsupported conversion
    When I run "pc convert part :cube_build123d -t step"
    Then the command should exit with a status code of "2"

  # A resolved part carries only the construction vocabulary. 'min' and 'max' are
  # the freedom-of-movement one, and they used to be written in here as a side
  # effect: 'InterfaceParameter.config_normalize' fills a missing bound in from
  # the default *in place*, and a shape's 'parameters:' was being handed to it.
  # The result was a 'partcad.yaml' that PartCAD's own schema rejects -- and
  # nonsense besides, since enrich then overrides the default and leaves the
  # bounds behind ("default: 4, min: 2, max: 2").
