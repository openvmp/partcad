@cli @pc-cam
Feature: `pc cam` command

  `pc cam` writes the program a machine cuts an object with. An object opts in
  by declaring a `cam:` section, and that section is the whole of the opt-in:
  with nothing named, every sketch and part of the package that declares one is
  routed and everything else is passed over in silence.

  Background: Create temporary $HOME and working directory
    Given I am in "/tmp/sandbox/behave" directory
    And I have temporary $HOME in "/tmp/sandbox/home"

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #
  # The one scenario that builds geometry                                     #
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------ #

  # Every scenario here gets a `$HOME` of its own, so every scenario that builds
  # a shape builds a CAD sandbox from nothing -- gigabytes, and minutes of pip.
  # So there is exactly one of those in this feature, and it asks everything
  # that needs a real route in one go: several `When I run` steps against one
  # prepared package share the sandbox the first one paid for.
