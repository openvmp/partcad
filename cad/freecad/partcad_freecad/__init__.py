"""The PartCAD addon for FreeCAD.

The package is split so that only the ``gui`` subpackage and :mod:`importer`
need FreeCAD (or Qt) to import. Everything else -- the JSON-RPC client, the
service provisioning, the package/object model and the parameter model -- is
plain Python and is unit tested without FreeCAD installed.
