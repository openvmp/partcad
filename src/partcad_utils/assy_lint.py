"""Position-accurate syntax and schema checking for PartCAD's YAML documents.

PartCAD writes two kinds of them, and they are the same kind of document: an
ASSY file (``*.assy``) and a package configuration (``partcad.yaml``) are both
Jinja2 templates that are rendered into YAML and then have to conform to a JSON
schema. (``partcad.yaml`` is rendered by `ProjectLocal`, with an
``includePaths`` of its own to pull fragments in.) That is three error classes a
user can hit in either of them -- a broken template, YAML that does not parse,
and YAML that parses but does not match the schema -- and an editor is only
useful if it can point at the *source* line of each one.

Which schema governs a file is `schema_for_file`, and it is the only thing that
differs between the two: everything below is about the shape they share.

Rendering the template first is not an option here: rendering needs the
parameter values, which are only known once the whole package is loaded, and it
destroys the mapping from a rendered line back to the line the user is typing.

So this module masks the template instead. Every Jinja2 construct is replaced,
in place, with an equally sized run of inert characters:

  * ``{{ expr }}`` becomes a filler scalar, so a templated value stays a value,
  * ``{% tag %}`` and ``{# comment #}`` become blanks, so a control-flow line
    stays an empty line, and a loop or conditional body is checked once.

Newlines inside a construct are preserved, so the masked document has exactly
the same line and column layout as the file on disk: a YAML parse error, or a
schema violation resolved through the composed YAML node tree, lands on the
character the user actually wrote.

Masking necessarily loses information -- what a ``{{ expr }}`` evaluates to, and
which branch of a ``{% if %}`` is taken -- so any finding that depends on that
lost information is dropped rather than reported. That trades a missed error for
never underlining correct code, which is the right trade for an editor.

It lives here, next to ``framing`` and ``workspace``, because neither end owns
it. The daemon checks a package's files when `pc lint` walks the package graph;
every client checks the one file somebody is editing, in its own process
(`partcad_client.lint`). Both are answering the same question about the same
documents, so a copy on each side is a copy that can disagree -- and a
disagreement here means the editor and CI contradicting each other about a file.
Nothing in this module needs a loaded PartCAD context, or ``partcad`` at all --
which is why both schemas are packaged beside it rather than under ``partcad``,
where reaching one would import the CAD kernel to read a JSON file.
