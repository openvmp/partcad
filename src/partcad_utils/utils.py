    Here, and shared, because the two things that report it -- 'pc system status'
    and the daemon's 'daemon status' -- had a copy each, and both copies had the
    bug below.

    What it walks is PartCAD's internal state directory: git clones, unpacked
    tarballs, and conda sandboxes being built and torn down by whatever else is
    running. So a name 'os.walk' just listed can be gone by the time this asks
    how big it is, and 'os.path.getsize' raises FileNotFoundError when it is.
    That is not an error to report -- the file is not there, so it contributes
    nothing -- but unhandled it aborted the whole report, which is how
    'test_system_status_reports_the_local_state' failed on macOS in CI with a
    dangling 'sandbox/pc-py-conda-3.9/include/python3.9/cellobject.h'.

    Regular files, and nothing else. 'os.walk' puts every non-directory entry in
    'filenames', so a socket, a FIFO or a device node arrives here alongside the
    files -- and 'st_size' means something different for each of them, none of it
    disk usage. They occupy no space worth reporting, so they are left out rather
    than counted as whatever their size field happens to hold.

    Symlinks are left out for a different reason: their target is either counted
    where it lives or outside this tree entirely, and following them would
    double-count a conda environment's hardlink farm.

    One 'os.lstat' answers both questions and asks the filesystem once, where
    'islink' followed by 'getsize' asked it twice and followed the link on the
    second ask. 'os.walk' swallows its own errors by default, so a directory
    that disappears needs nothing extra; a path that was never there yields no
