"""The CLI-shaped JSON-RPC method registry.

Method names mirror ``partcad-cli`` subcommands (``inspect.part``,
``export.assembly``, ``list.all``, ``info``, ...). Each maps to a transport-
agnostic operation in :mod:`partcad_service_json_rpc.core.operations`. The
``rpc.discover`` method returns the machine-readable catalog, with each method's
summary taken from the operation's docstring.

    PartCAD scopes a few things to "the command now running" -- so far, the
    deadline latch that stops a runaway plugin script from being asked again
    (:mod:`partcad.plugin`). A CLI process runs one command and exits, so
    nothing there has to say where one ends. The daemon serves many, against
    contexts it keeps warm indefinitely, so this is where it says so.

    Wrapping the registry rather than, say, the shared ``_ctx()`` helper: every
    method gets the same treatment whether or not it takes a context, and no
    operation can be written later that quietly skips it.

    Skipped while PartCAD is unimported -- there are no plugins to un-latch yet,
    and a meta method like ``rpc.discover`` should not pay for the import.
