    With no object named this is a *package-level* command, which is what
    separates it from `pc cae fea`: an analysis is asked of one part, while a
    route is what a package's cut list is made of, and the objects that have one
    are exactly the objects that declare a `cam:` section. Everything else in
    the package is passed over without a word.

    The report is printed by the daemon through PartCAD logging, exactly as
    `pc cae` prints its findings, so that what a user sees does not depend on
    which client asked. `--json` is the exception: a machine-readable array has
    to reach stdout of *this* process to be piped anywhere.
