"""Opening a file in a third-party application, on the machine the client runs on.

This is a client's job by construction, and it is why the code sits here rather
than behind an RPC method. A daemon can be remote: "open this in FreeCAD" sent to
one would start a window on somebody else's desk, on a machine that may have no
display at all -- and the file named on the command line is the client's own,
found by a path that means nothing on the other side of the wire. So `pc open`
never speaks to a daemon, the way `pc lint --file` and `pc upgrade` do not, and
the VS Code extension reaches this code by running `pc open` rather than by
reimplementing it in TypeScript.

Two ways to run a tool, tried in this order:

* **Natively**, when the machine has the application installed. Nothing is
  containerised, nothing is downloaded, and the application sees the file at the
  path the user typed.
* **In a container**, when it does not, Docker is available, and the caller
  passed ``use_docker``. One long-lived container per tool, named
  ``partcad-<tool>`` -- a *container* name, not an image name, so a user can
  create, inspect, customise or `docker rm` theirs, and the next `pc open` finds
  and reuses whatever is there.

The container mounts the workspace root **at the same absolute path** it has on
the host, along with the directory holding the workspace's daemon socket. Same
path on both sides is what keeps the arrangement honest: the file argument, an
error message, and anything the application writes back all name one path that
means the same thing inside the container, on the host, and to the daemon.

Some applications read triangles and nothing else. Blender is the one PartCAD
knows about: its command line takes a `.blend` to open, and any other geometry
has to be *imported*, which only a mesh format can be. So a file that is not
already a mesh is converted to STL first, and the application is handed that
instead. Which types are meshes is `partcad_client.object_types`; making one out
of a solid is CAD work, so it is not done here -- the caller passes a
``transcode`` callback, and `pc open` implements it as the same `adhoc.convert`
the daemon serves `pc adhoc convert` with. The converted copy is written under
the workspace's own state directory, which is already mounted into the container
at the path it has here, so one name means the same thing on both sides.

Some read a *scene* and only their own description of one. MuJoCo is that one:
it reads MJCF, and a Gazebo world handed to it is not a slow way of opening a
scene, it is a file it cannot read. So the same thing happens for the same
reason -- the scene is written out as MJCF first, through the very same
``transcode`` callback with ``kind="scene"``. The two conversions differ in what
they ask of the file (does it hold triangles, versus which description language
is it) and in what they convert (a part, versus a scene); everything after that
is shared, which is why one callback serves both.

A containerised GUI needs an X server on the host, which is the one place where
this cannot paper over the difference between platforms. On Linux the display is
usually a socket that can simply be shared, cookie and all, and nothing has to be
set up; on macOS and Windows -- and on Linux over a forwarded display -- it is a
TCP connection to an X server the user has to install and allow. There is no way
to do that for them, so when it is missing they get told which one to install and
what to run, rather than a container that starts and silently never shows a window.
