"""PartCAD's own expression syntax, ``%<expression>%``.

Jinja2 owns ``{{ ... }}`` and ``{% ... %}`` in ``partcad.yaml``: the file is
rendered as a template *before* it is parsed (see 'ProjectLocal'), so anything
written that way is resolved at load time, where the parameter values of an
individual object do not exist yet. An expression that has to wait for those
values therefore cannot be spelled in Jinja2's syntax at all - it would be
evaluated, and fail, one step too early.

``%...%`` is what is left. The delimiters are not new here: the names in an
interface's ``inherits:`` section have been resolved this way since interfaces
were introduced, in the one form ``%name:expression%``. This module is that
mechanism generalized - the same delimiters, applied to any string in a
declaration and over all of the object's parameters rather than one named one -
and the historical form still means what it meant.

Three forms, tried in this order:

* ``%name%`` - the value of the parameter called ``name``, with its own type.
  A location entry written ``"%depth%"`` stays the number it was declared as.
  New: the historical resolver required the colon below and raised without it.
* ``%name:expression%`` - the historical form, where ``name`` is a parameter and
  ``value`` is bound to its value inside ``expression``.
* ``%expression%`` - arithmetic over the object's parameters, e.g. ``%size / 2%``
  or ``%-width / 2 + offset%``.

What an expression may do is checked rather than assumed ('_ALLOWED_NODES',
'SAFE_ATTRIBUTES'), because a declaration is read whenever a package is loaded,
long before anything is built and any CAD script runs. Arithmetic, comparisons,
a conditional, indexing, and the plain methods of a string or a number: enough
for ``value[1:value.index('-')]``, which is what the historical form is used
for, and not enough to reach an object's insides.

A string that is *exactly* one expression evaluates to the value itself, so a
number stays a number. A string that merely contains one (``"m;size=%size%"``,
``"%depth%mm deep"``) gets the value formatted into it.
