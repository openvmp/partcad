"""Capping how much of one kind of work runs at once, without deadlocking on it.

PartCAD gates its tests and its linting checks so that a recursive run does not
start every check on every object of every package at once. The gate has to hold
two properties that a bare :class:`asyncio.Semaphore` does not, and losing either
one stops the event loop for good rather than slowing it down.

**It is re-entrant.** A check may run the other checks itself: ``ManufacturabilityTest.test``
walks everything an assembly is procured from and runs the whole suite over each
of those objects, and it does that from inside the very call the gate has already
admitted. A plain semaphore counts that nested call as a new arrival, so once as
many callers as the limit are each waiting on a nested call, every permit is held
by somebody waiting for a permit and nothing ever completes. Nested work is
charged to the permit its caller already holds instead.

**It is per event loop.** ``asyncio.Semaphore`` is not thread-safe and binds
itself to the loop it first blocks on, while PartCAD runs an ``asyncio.run()``
per worker thread (``ThreadPoolManager.run_async``) and the JSON-RPC daemon runs
one per request. A single process-wide semaphore is therefore shared between
loops that cannot see each other's waiters -- and, in a daemon, outlives the loop
it was bound to, so the second command of a session is refused by a primitive
belonging to the first command's closed loop.
