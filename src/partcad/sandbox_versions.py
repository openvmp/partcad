Every factory that renders a part or a sketch through a sandboxed interpreter

#
# 2.11.0 publishes no macOS x86_64 wheel at all -- five for arm64, none for
# Intel -- and it ships no sdist either, so there is nothing for pip to fall back
# to and build. Pinned exactly at 2.11.0 this left every Intel Mac
# unable to provision a CAD sandbox at all: "Could not find a version that
# satisfies the requirement nlopt==2.11.0", and then every script-defined part
# failing on an import of something that was never installed. It went unnoticed
# because nothing ran a sandbox on that platform until the macos-15-x86_64
# bundle got an "Examples" job in "build-standalone.yml".
#
# 2.9.1 is where Intel macOS support stops: it publishes cp39 through cp313 for
# that platform, and 2.10.0 and 2.11.0 publish none at all. So the range admits
# three releases -- 2.9.1, 2.10.0 and 2.11.0 -- and each platform resolves to the
# newest it can install: 2.11.0 on Linux, Windows and Apple silicon, 2.9.1 on
# Intel macOS. 2.10.0 is never the answer anywhere, having the same platform
# coverage as 2.11.0 and a lower version.
#
# The bound is closed on both ends, which keeps this as deterministic as an exact
# pin: versions only ever go up, so those three are the whole candidate set for
# good. And nlopt is deliberately not in the "pins must be exact" set that
# 'test_cad_pins_are_exact' guards -- that rule exists because two OCP builds in
# one sandbox crash the wrapper with no traceback, and nlopt writes no part of
# the OCP native module.
#
# One gap remains and this does not close it: nlopt publishes Intel macOS wheels
# up to cp313 only, so a 3.14 sandbox there still finds no candidate. The default

    NOT redundant, however much it looks it. "python==3.14" names a version and

    single release: the ordinary one ("*_cp314") and the free-threaded, no-GIL
    one ("*_cp314t"). Which one an unconstrained solve lands on is the solver's
    business, and on the CI runners it landed on the free-threaded one -- the
    sandbox came out at "lib/python3.14t/site-packages".

    Nothing in PartCAD wants that build, and the whole CAD stack is unusable in
    it: cadquery-ocp and nlopt publish "cp314-cp314" wheels and no "cp314t" ones,
    so pip finds no candidate at all ("Could not find a version that satisfies
    the requirement nlopt>=2.9.1,<=2.11.0"), and every part defined by a script
    then dies with "No module named 'OCP'". Remove this and that comes back.

    The pin goes on 'python_abi' rather than on the 'python' spec itself. A build
    string can only be given in conda's three-field "name=version=build" form, so
    pinning it on 'python' would mean rewriting the version half of the spec the
    caller asked for as well. 'python_abi' is a package the interpreter already
    depends on -- python 3.14 declares "python_abi 3.14.* *_cp314" -- so pinning
    its build string pins the interpreter's without touching the python spec and
    without adding anything to the environment that was not going in anyway.

    None below 3.13: there CPython has no free-threaded build to disambiguate,
    and conda-forge's build strings end in "_cpython" rather than "_cp312", so a
    "*_cp312" pin would match no package at all and fail the solve outright.

    'exact' picks the spelling of the equality: mamba is given "==", conda "=".
    Both select the same package here, since python_abi's version is the bare
    "<major>.<minor>" and there is no patch component for the two to disagree
    about. That is a property of this package alone, and does not carry over to
    the 'python' spec beside it: libmamba reads "python==3.14" as the 3.14
    release exactly, i.e. 3.14.0, so that one is always spelled with a single
    "=" (see CondaPythonRuntime.once_conda_locked_attempt).

    That is also why both halves of the spec are derived from _major_minor()
    rather than from the caller's string: a "3.13.1" would otherwise ask for a
    python_abi release that does not exist and for a "*_cp3131" build that names
    no ABI. See _major_minor() for how such a version gets here.

# environment is instead identified by the very set of dependencies it holds
# (see runtime_javascript.env_dir_name), so a part that asks for its own Chili3D
# gets its own tree and cannot reach anyone else's - which means the version can
# simply be a package's or a part's to choose.
