# The object types this PartCAD used to support and deliberately removed, each
# mapped to the release that removed it.
#
# These are 'part' types, and only 'part' types. All four are the built-in
# generative-AI part types retired by #486 ("retire the built-in generative-AI
# functionality"), which deleted the 'part_factory_ai_*' modules together with
# their 'register()' calls - every one of which was a
# 'factory.register("part", ...)'. The public index is a separate repository and
# still declares them, as does every package published while they existed - so
# this is not something the user of such a package can correct. That is why
# naming one of these is a warning and the object is skipped, while any other
# unknown type stays an error (see 'Project.record_broken_object').
#
# Because the scope is 'part', 'instantiate' consults this only for that kind.
# The same name on a sketch, an assembly, a provider or a repository was never a
# type PartCAD had, so it is not a retirement and must not be forgiven as one -
# and calling it retired would name a release that never supported it. Should a
# non-part type ever be retired, this map has to grow a kind before that entry
# can be added to it.
#
# Nothing else belongs in here. A type that never existed, or a typo in the
# user's own package, must keep failing loudly.

    ones that exist today.

    Which types accept which is decided by the factory classes (see
    'PartFactory.ACCEPTED_OBJECT_TYPE_PARAMETERS'), not by the schema: the
