"""The throwaway package an ad-hoc command works inside.

`pc adhoc convert` and `pc adhoc render` both operate on a file that belongs to
no package: PartCAD writes a `partcad.yaml` in a temporary directory declaring
that one file as its only object, builds a context around it, produces one
output file, and deletes the directory again.

Everything specific to a verb lives in `convert.py` and `render.py`; what is
here is the part they share, so that a change to how the throwaway package is
built cannot mean one thing for a conversion and another for a projection.
