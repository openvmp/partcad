# The properties of an 'enrich' declaration that describe the reference itself
# rather than the object it resolves to: which object is being enriched, which
# package it is in, and how it is to be parametrized. They say nothing once the
# reference has been resolved - what the resolved object records instead is
# 'source', the fully qualified name of the instance behind it - so they are
# not carried onto it. Everything else an enrich declares ('desc', 'offset',
# 'scale', the render settings) describes the object it produces and is kept.
#
# 'package' and 'project' are two spellings of the same thing, and 'path' and
# 'type' come from the instance, which is what is actually built.

# What belongs to the object an enrich points at and to nothing else. An
# 'aliases:' entry is a name the *source's* package publishes for the source,
# and a package does not gain a part called 'box' because one of its enriches
# happens to point at something that has one. The enrich publishes its own
# aliases if it declares them - that is an ordinary property of the declaration,
# and it is kept.
SOURCE_ONLY_PROPERTIES = frozenset({"aliases"})

# What the object an enrich points at has already applied to itself by the time
# it hands its geometry back: 'get_wrapped()' places and scales what a factory
# produced, and the instance now materializes itself (see 'PartFactoryAlias').
# So an enrich reports the instance's parameters but not its placement, or it
# would apply it a second time. An enrich's own 'offset'/'scale' still apply,
# on top of what the instance produced.

# What an enrich cannot act on: everything that says how an object is *built*.
# An enrich does not build anything - it points at an instance of an object
# another declaration defines, and that declaration is what says where the file
# is, which interpreter and packages it is built with, and what it is built
# from. Declaring one of these on an enrich has never had an effect worth
# relying on, and now has none at all, so it is reported rather than ignored in
# silence.
#
# 'parameters' is here for the same reason: an enrich states which values it
# wants through 'with', and redeclaring the parameters of the object it points
# at does not change which instance of it that is.
#
# Deliberately a list of what is ignored rather than of what is honoured: a key
# that is neither describes the object an enrich produces ('desc', 'offset',
# the render settings), and those are carried onto it. Something new that
# belongs on this side has to be added here.
