"""How an output file type is configured and who implements it.

PartCAD writes output files in two flavours, each declared in a section of
'partcad.yaml' of the same name:

    'export:'   the 3D and CAD formats 'pc export' writes
    'render:'   the 2D projections 'pc render' writes

Two more sections are resolved by exactly the same machinery and produce no
output file at all -- 'import:' (who *reads* a file format into a PartCAD
object) and 'simulation:' (who runs a scene). See SIMULATE and IMPORT below.

A section has one subsection per file type, whose fields are that type's
parameters. Some of them are not parameters but say how the file is produced -
'path' (the implementation script), 'package' (where that script lives),
'pythonRequirements' and 'pythonVersion' (what its sandbox needs, and which
interpreter it is) - and three more describe where the output goes rather than
what goes in it. Everything else is handed to the implementation verbatim, which
is what lets a package add a parameter (say, a 'comment' for STEP) without
PartCAD having to know about it.

The first four are not layered like the rest. 'path' and 'package' say whose
script this is, and 'pythonVersion' and 'pythonRequirements' describe the
environment that script needs - which only the package that wrote it can
answer. All four are therefore read from that package alone; a copy of them
that reaches the merged options from a calling package is inert (see
'Implementation.python_version()').

The built-in implementations are not special-cased anywhere: they are declared
in exactly this form by three packages that ship inside 'partcad' itself and
that every context can reach -- '//builtin/export', '//builtin/render' and
'//builtin/import' (see 'builtin/'). Resolving a file type means layering the configuration of the
package that asked for it on top of the built-in package's, so a package that
declares 'path' for a type replaces the implementation for itself and one that
declares only a parameter keeps the built-in implementation and re-tunes it.

SECTIONS = (EXPORT, RENDER)

# The analysis section, which is an output section of the same shape and is
# deliberately not one of 'SECTIONS'. A file type declared under 'cae:' is
# produced by a script exactly as an export or a render one is - same 'path',
# same 'package', same sandbox, same parameters - and 'Implementation' below
# serves it unchanged. What differs is who asks for it and what comes back:
# 'pc cae fea' asks, and the implementation answers with findings beside the
# file it wrote (see 'partcad.cae').
#
# It stays out of 'SECTIONS' because 'SECTIONS' answers the question "which
# sections does a file type of 'pc export'/'pc render' live in": a 'fea' left in
# there would be offered to 'pc render -t' and would fall back to a 'render:'
# implementation, and neither is a thing a solver can do.
CAE = "cae"
ANALYSIS_SECTIONS = (CAE,)
ALL_SECTIONS = SECTIONS + ANALYSIS_SECTIONS

# Another section resolved the same way that produces no output file at all:
# 'simulation:' declares the plugins 'pc sim' runs a scene through. Out of
# 'SECTIONS' for the reason 'cae:' is, and out of 'ANALYSIS_SECTIONS' too -- a
# simulation names no file type, so there is nothing for 'pc export -t' or
# 'pc cae' to be offered. It is an 'Implementation' like any other: a script,
# the sandbox it needs, and the parameters it is handed. See
# 'partcad.simulation'.
#
# Like 'cae:', PartCAD implements *nothing* of it. There is no
# '//builtin/simulate', on purpose and for the reason there is no built-in
# solver: a simulator is somebody's program with a release cycle of its own, and
# shipping one inside the wheel would make every PartCAD release a statement
# about which version of it you get. PartCAD ships the concept -- this section,
# 'wrappers/wrapper_simulate.py', the runner in 'partcad.simulation', and the
# MJCF export a plugin is handed a scene through -- and a package supplies the
# simulator. The MuJoCo one is 'partcad/partcad-sim-mujoco'.
SIMULATE = "simulation"

# The fourth, and the mirror image of 'export:': 'import:' declares who turns a
# file of some third-party format *into* a PartCAD object. It is not in SECTIONS
# for the same reason 'simulation:' is not -- everything reading that tuple is
# asking "which output file types are there", and an importer produces no file.
#
# It exists because reading a format and writing it are one piece of knowledge.
# A package that teaches PartCAD to write MJCF knows MJCF; making it declare the
# reader beside the writer is what lets the pair travel together, be versioned
# together, and be replaced together. Before this section there was no way to
# say it: every reader was a factory class registered in 'globals.py', so adding
# one meant editing PartCAD.
#
# Unlike 'simulation:', this one does have a built-in package. A reader is not a
# simulator: it is XML and geometry, it depends on nothing with a release cycle
# of its own, and 'urdf' in particular describes a robot rather than any one
# engine's world, so it ships here. The two that *are* an engine's own scene
# format live with that engine's plugin -- 'mjcf' in 'partcad/partcad-sim-mujoco'
# and 'world' in 'partcad/partcad-sim-gazebo'.
#
# 'import:' was the historical spelling of 'dependencies:', which is why a
# package whose 'import:' describes transports rather than readers is told to
# rename it rather than quietly migrated ('ProjectConfiguration' used to copy
# the value into 'dependencies'; see 'project_config.py'). The name is this
# section's now, and it is the right one: what an entry declares is how a file
# of that format is read *in*, which is the mirror of 'export:' and reads that
# way beside it.
#
# What an entry declares, beyond the implementation keys every section shares:
#
#   'kinds'      which object kinds the reader can produce ('assembly',
#                'scene', or both). A format used for one thing only says so,
#                and declaring it under the wrong section is then an error a
#                package gets told about rather than a tree that comes out
#                empty.
#   'extension'  the source file's extension, used to find the file when the
#                declaration names no 'path'.
#   'noun'       what one of these is called in a log line ('model', 'world').
#   'dropped'    what each counter of the reader's 'dropped' summary is called
#                when it is reported -- the reader counts, the declaration
#                words it.
#
# Everything else is handed to the reader as a parameter, which is what lets a
# format carry its own options ('ignoreCollision', 'modelPaths') without PartCAD
# knowing they exist.
IMPORT = "import"

# The fifth, and the only one whose implementation is not a script: 'open:'
# declares the third-party applications 'pc open' can launch. An entry is data
# and nothing else -- where the application is on each operating system, what to
# run it as, which container to fall back to, and what it can read -- because
# the one thing that would be code is the same for every tool there is, and
# lives once in 'partcad_client.external'.
#
# It is resolved the same way as the rest, and for the same reason: an
# application belongs to whoever knows it. Gazebo and MuJoCo are declared by
# their engine's plugin package, beside the exporter, the reader and the
# simulator for that engine's own scene format; a package that wraps some other
# tool adds it without PartCAD having heard of it.
#
# 'pc open' is a client-side command that deliberately needs no package graph
# (see 'partcad_cli.click.commands.open'), so the built-in half of this table is
# read straight off disk out of the wheel and needs no context at all. Only a
# tool a *package* declares needs one, and that is the daemon's to answer.

    part or a sketch, which is a stricter thing to be than an output file in
    general - so it also serves where any output file would do. The reverse

    which names the package the implementation lives in.

    nothing in '//builtin/export' writes MJCF or SDFormat, because an engine's
    own scene format travels with that engine's plugin package, so
    'pc export -t mjcf' has nothing to resolve and 'pc export -t sim-mujoco:mjcf'
    has.

    Returns the bare name and the package path, or the name and None. Turning
