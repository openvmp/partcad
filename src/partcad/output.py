"""How an output file type is configured and who implements it.

PartCAD writes output files in two flavours, each declared in a section of
'partcad.yaml' of the same name:

    'export:'   the 3D and CAD formats 'pc export' writes
    'render:'   the 2D projections 'pc render' writes

A section has one subsection per file type, whose fields are that type's
parameters. Some of them are not parameters but say how the file is produced -
'path' (the implementation script), 'package' (where that script lives),
'pythonRequirements' and 'pythonVersion' (what its sandbox needs, and which
interpreter it is) - and three more describe where the output goes rather than
what goes in it. Everything else is handed to the implementation verbatim, which
is what lets a package add a parameter (say, a 'comment' for STEP) without
PartCAD having to know about it.

The first four are not layered like the rest. 'path' and 'package' say whose
script this is, and 'pythonVersion' and 'pythonRequirements' describe the
environment that script needs - which only the package that wrote it can
answer. All four are therefore read from that package alone; a copy of them
that reaches the merged options from a calling package is inert (see
'Implementation.python_version()').

The built-in implementations are not special-cased anywhere: they are declared
in exactly this form by two packages that ship inside 'partcad' itself and that
every context can reach, '//builtin/export' and '//builtin/render' (see
'builtin/'). Resolving a file type means layering the configuration of the
package that asked for it on top of the built-in package's, so a package that
declares 'path' for a type replaces the implementation for itself and one that
declares only a parameter keeps the built-in implementation and re-tunes it.
