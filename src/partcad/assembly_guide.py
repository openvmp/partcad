"""Assembly documents: what a generated document says about an assembly.

Three documents are generated from an assembly, and this module is what they
have in common. The markdown one ('pc render -t readme') lists what the assembly
is made of; the PDF ('-t pdf') and the HTML ('-t html') are an assembly
instruction book - the same bill of materials, plus a page for every step of
putting the thing together. All three are built here as the format-independent
model in 'document.py', so they cannot drift apart, and each output format is
just a way of writing that model down.

The instruction book is only defined for an assembly that PartCAD knows how to
assemble, which today means an Assembly YAML (ASSY) file: that is where the
order of the steps and the joints between the items come from. Anything else -
an assembly imported as a single file, an alias to something that is not an
ASSY - has no steps to describe, and is refused rather than silently reduced to
a title page and a parts list.
