class Configuration:
    """Holds the already-parsed configuration of a package.

    This class performs no I/O. Loading the configuration is the responsibility
    of the subclass (e.g. 'ProjectLocal' reads and renders 'partcad.yaml'),
    which then hands the result over explicitly:

        class ProjectLocal(Project):
            def __init__(self, ctx, name, path, ...):
                config_obj = <read, render and parse partcad.yaml>
                super().__init__(ctx, name, path=<dir>, config_obj=config_obj, ...)

    'path' and 'config_obj' are constructor parameters on purpose, rather than
    attributes the subclass is expected to have assigned before it calls
    'super().__init__()'. That implicit ordering contract is easy to get wrong:
    this constructor used to reset 'self.config_obj' here, which silently
    discarded the configuration the subclass had just parsed, and it used to
    read 'self.path', which made every subclass that had not assigned it yet
    fail with an AttributeError.

    Note that 'self.name' is not guaranteed to equal the 'name' argument on
    return: the root package may rename itself via the 'name' key of its
    configuration. Callers which registered the object under the requested name
    must re-key it afterwards - see 'Context.import_project()'.
