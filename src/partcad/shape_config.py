        The one reader of the manufacturing tolerance. There are three places
        the answer can come from and they are not interchangeable, so nothing
        outside this reads any of them directly:

        1. The 'tolerance:' field of the declaration, for the types that take
           one. An author who wrote it down meant it, and it outranks the file:
           it is written precisely because the file did not say, and a file that
           later starts saying something else is a change to argue about rather
           than one to silently adopt.
        2. What the file itself states, for the types whose format can state it.
           A STEP file carrying GD&T already says how precisely each feature has
           to be made, in more detail than one number holds - so a file that
           tolerances several features differently answers NaN, which means
           "tolerated, feature by feature" and not "unknown". See
           'tolerance_inspect.reduce()'.
        3. The 'tolerance' object-type parameter, for the homogeneous types that
           accept it, which reads back as its type's default of 0.0 when nothing
           declared one.

        None is reserved for the object that has no way to answer at all: a type
        that takes neither the field nor the parameter, and whose file states
        nothing. It is not the same as 0.0, which is what "nobody said" reads as
        on a type that could have said - and the manufacturability test reports
        the two differently, because one is a declaration to fix and the other a
        part type to think again about.

        Asynchronous because of case 2, which reads a file, and because an
        object whose file is not there yet ('kicad' builds its STEP, a part with
        'fileFrom' downloads it) has to be free to answer without one.

        own 'parameters:' - and differs in what happens when nothing is
        declared: the default comes from the type that produces the shape, not
        from here.

        The default is applied *here*, on the way out, and is deliberately never
        written into 'config["parameters"]'. 'Shape.__init__' hashes that
        dictionary into the shape's cache key, so injecting a default would move
        the key of every homogeneous part that never mentioned a tolerance - a
        mass invalidation of existing cache entries for a value nobody set. Read
        this way, an undeclared tolerance stays out of the hash entirely, while a
        tolerance somebody did declare keys the cache like any other input,
        because it is one.

        The default doubles as the parameter's type witness: a numeric default
        means the parameter is numeric, so a declared value is coerced to a
        number. A value that will not coerce is reported and the default is used
