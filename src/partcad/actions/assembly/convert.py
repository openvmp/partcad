"""Core-side entry point for 'pc convert assembly'.

Converts an assembly between the two formats that can express one:

  * **to URDF** - the assembly is exported as a ``.urdf`` file plus a directory
    of the STL files it references, one per distinct shape in it, and the
    package's declaration switches to ``type: urdf``.

  * **to ASSY** - every URDF link becomes an ``stl`` part of the package and
    every URDF joint becomes a pair of PartCAD interfaces, so the resulting
    ``.assy`` places its parts with ``connect:`` rather than with hard-coded
    coordinates. The package's declaration switches to ``type: assy``.

The second direction is where the two models actually have to be reconciled, and
the mapping is described in docs/source/simulation.rst. In short: a URDF joint
relates two link frames, while PartCAD relates two *ports* that face each other,
so each joint becomes a "socket" interface the parent implements at the joint
origin and a "plug" interface the child implements at its own origin. Joints
that say the same thing share one pair of interfaces.
