"""Core-side entry point for 'pc import scene'.

An import reads a foreign file and leaves the package holding *PartCAD's own*
objects - parts it can render on their own and an ``.assy`` that places them -
rather than a declaration that points back at the foreign file. (Declaring one
is what ``pc add scene`` is for, and it is the right thing when the world file
is the source of truth and somebody else maintains it.)

One format is supported, and it is the one that describes an arrangement:

  * **Gazebo world** (``.world``, SDFormat) - every shape a model places
    becomes a part of the package, carrying whatever the world said about it,
    and the arrangement becomes an ``.assy`` scene that places them.

The world is read in a sandbox (see wrappers/wrapper_import_world.py), so this
module never touches a live OCP object.
