# 'import_scene' is the 'pc import scene' entry point and 'convert' is the

# named by the format's own 'import:' declaration -- so neither needs a CAD
# library in the core process and both are safe to import here. They are still
# loaded lazily, on first access rather than at 'import partcad' time, to keep
# the import graph shallow. 'from ...scene import import_scene_action' resolves
# through the module __getattr__ below.
