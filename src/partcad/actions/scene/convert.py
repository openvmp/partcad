"""Core-side entry point for 'pc convert scene'.

Converts a scene between the two formats that can express one:

  * **to world** - the scene is exported as a Gazebo ``.world`` file
    (SDFormat) plus a directory of the mesh files it references, and the
    package's declaration switches to ``type: world``.

  * **to assy** - every shape the world places becomes a part of the package
    and the arrangement becomes an ``.assy`` that places them, so the package
    ends up holding PartCAD's own objects. The declaration switches to
    ``type: assy``.

This is the scene counterpart of 'pc convert assembly', and it is deliberately
the simpler of the two. Converting a URDF assembly to ASSY has to reconcile two
different models of *connection* - a URDF joint against a pair of PartCAD ports
- because an assembly says how it is put together. A scene says only where
things are, and SDFormat's poses are placements just as an ASSY's ``location:``
is, so nothing has to be invented in either direction: what a world's joints
say is what a scene does not carry in the first place (see
'assembly_factory_imported').
