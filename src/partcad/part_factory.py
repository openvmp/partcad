    # no per-part-type branching at all.

    # Two class-level sets, so the mechanism is not welded to the one parameter
    # that exists today.
    #
    # POLICED_OBJECT_TYPE_PARAMETERS is the registry of names policed at all,
    # and stays a plain set of names: whether a name is policed is a property
    # of the name, the same everywhere. Only a name in here may ever be
    # rejected. Parameters are otherwise arbitrary - a script may call its own
    # whatever it likes - so a name that is not in this registry must stay free
    # on every type, forever.
    #
    # A name, not a shape of declaration: a parameter *named* 'color' is
    # policed, while the 'color:' and 'material:' fields a parameter of any
    # name may carry inside its own definition (see 'shape-parameter' in the
    # schema, and 'features/lint.feature') are a different thing entirely and
    # are never looked at here.

    # ACCEPTED_OBJECT_TYPE_PARAMETERS is what *this* factory accepts of the
    # policed names, mapped to the default each reads back as when nothing
    # declares it. 'NO_DEFAULT' means absent stays absent. Empty here, which
    # makes "does not accept" the default: a type opts in by mixing in a class
    # that widens the mapping (see 'PartFactoryHomogen'). The types that have
    # not opted in are deliberate, not an oversight - whether each of them
    # should accept these has not been decided, and will be settled case by
    # case. Defaulting to "no" is what leaves that decision open; defaulting to
    # "yes" would silently make it.
    #
    # Only what is *accepted* carries defaults, which is why this is a mapping
    # and the registry above is not. A default is what a type promises about a
    # parameter it honours, and a type that rejects a parameter promises
    # nothing about it.

    # Whether a part of this type may carry a 'tolerance:' field of its own, and

    #
    # A second way for a part to say what the 'tolerance' object-type parameter
    # above says, for the types that cannot say it that way. A 'step' part
    # rejects the object-type parameters because a STEP file may hold many
    # solids and already states what each of them is (see 'PartFactoryHomogen'),
    # and for 'material' and 'color' that is the end of it: the file answers. For
    # 'tolerance' it is not, because plenty of STEP files carry no GD&T at all,
    # and a part read from one of those has no way left to say how precisely it
    # has to be made - which is what 'pc test' demands of anything that is going
    # to be manufactured.
    #
    # So the field. It is a field rather than a parameter because it is not a
    # request made of the type that produces the shape - nothing is built
    # differently for it, and the file is read the same way either way - and
    # because the parameter of that name stays rejected for the reason it always
    # was.
    #
    # The two attributes are separate because they answer separate questions. A
    # type could gain a file format that states a tolerance without gaining a
    # field (the file would always answer), or a field without a format (nothing
    # to read). Today one type sets both.

          feature", which 'pc test' accepts. NaN is
          'tolerance_inspect.reduce()'s to produce, and nothing else's.
        * '.inf' and '-.inf' are neither zero nor NaN, so they pass as though
          they were a real tolerance.
        * A negative number is the same, and the schema has said 'minimum: 0'
          all along - it is simply not enforced while a package is loaded.
        * 'true' is an int in Python and reads back as one millimetre. YAML
          makes that one easy to write by accident, because 'yes' is 'True'
          rather than the word, and a millimetre is plausible enough to go
