    # Object-type parameters: the parameters an object *type* contributes to
    # the parameter list, rather than the author of the part declaring them
    # from nothing. They are told apart from the rest here, in the factory
    # layer, because that is the only layer that knows what type produced the
    # part: the schema accepts any parameter name matching its pattern and has
    # no per-part-type branching at all.

    # Two class-level sets, so the mechanism is not welded to the one parameter
    # that exists today.
    #
    # POLICED_OBJECT_TYPE_PARAMETERS is the registry of names policed at all,
    # and stays a plain set of names: whether a name is policed is a property
    # of the name, the same everywhere. Only a name in here may ever be
    # rejected. Parameters are otherwise arbitrary - a script may call its own
    # whatever it likes - so a name that is not in this registry must stay free
    # on every type, forever.
    #
    # A name, not a shape of declaration: a parameter *named* 'color' is
    # policed, while the 'color:' and 'material:' fields a parameter of any
    # name may carry inside its own definition (see 'shape-parameter' in the
    # schema, and 'features/lint.feature') are a different thing entirely and
    # are never looked at here.

    # policed names, mapped to the default each reads back as when nothing
    # declares it. 'NO_DEFAULT' means absent stays absent. Empty here, which
    # makes "does not accept" the default: a type opts in by mixing in a class
    # that widens the mapping (see 'PartFactoryHomogen'). The types that have
    # not opted in are deliberate, not an oversight - whether each of them
    # should accept these has not been decided, and will be settled case by
    # case. Defaulting to "no" is what leaves that decision open; defaulting to
    # "yes" would silently make it.
    #
    # Only what is *accepted* carries defaults, which is why this is a mapping
    # and the registry above is not. A default is what a type promises about a
    # parameter it honours, and a type that rejects a parameter promises
    # nothing about it.
