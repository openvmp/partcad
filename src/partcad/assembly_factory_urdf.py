"""The 'urdf' assembly type: a URDF file used directly as a PartCAD assembly.

A URDF describes a robot as links joined by joints. PartCAD's assembly is a
static tree of placed shapes, so the two meet at the URDF's zero configuration:
every link is placed where its joints put it with all of them at zero, and the
result is the very same in-memory representation an ASSY file produces - a tree
of 'Assembly'/'AssemblyChild' objects wrapping 'Part's. Everything downstream
(rendering, export, BoM, inspection, caching) therefore treats a URDF assembly
and an ASSY assembly identically.

Every link becomes one part, registered into the package as
``<assembly name>/<link name>``. Those parts are ordinary parts: they can be
inspected, rendered and exported on their own. They are not declared in
``partcad.yaml`` - the URDF is what declares them - so a package resolves such a
name by building the assembly that owns it first (see
``Project._derived_part_owner``).

The reading is done by wrapper_import_urdf inside a python sandbox: URDF is
parsed with ROS's own 'urdf_parser_py', which PartCAD does not depend on, and
turning URDF geometry into shapes needs OCCT, which the core process never
loads. What comes back here is plain data.

What a URDF says about a link's physics - mass, centre of mass, inertia,
friction, contact - becomes named properties of the part, one PartCAD property
per URDF value, in PartCAD's own units. Nothing is stashed in a container of
its own, and URDF content PartCAD has no property for stops the import rather
than being carried opaquely; the tables that decide this live in
wrapper_import_urdf.py. What a static assembly simply cannot show - a movable
joint, a transmission - is counted and reported.
docs/source/simulation.rst describes the gap and what closing it would take.
