def as_wires(request):
    """What the selected layers draw, as wires, for a drawing that has no faces.

    CadQuery's importer builds *faces*: it merges each layer's entities into
    wires and then asks each wire for the face it bounds. A drawing whose lines
    do not close bounds nothing, so the whole import fails - and a drawing whose
    lines do not close is precisely what sheet metal bend instructions are. Two
    parallel lines across a blank are where it is folded, and they are open by
    nature.

    So when the face import fails, the wires themselves are the answer. They are
    what the drawing states, they are what an annotation is written against, and
    a sketch of them is a perfectly good sketch - it is only not a face.

    Only ever reached *after* the face import has raised, which is what keeps
    every drawing that imports today importing exactly as it did: this is a
    second answer to a question that otherwise had none, never a different
    answer to one that had one.

    The layer selection is CadQuery's own, mirrored here because this does not
    go through its importer: names are matched case-insensitively, and 'include'
    and 'exclude' are mutually exclusive. 'dxf_metadata.is_included' applies the
    same rule to the annotations, so the two describe one set of elements.
