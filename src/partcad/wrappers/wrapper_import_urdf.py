"""Read a URDF file and return the plain data PartCAD builds an assembly from.

This runs inside the python sandbox, for two reasons. The URDF parser is ROS's
own 'urdf_parser_py' rather than an XML reader written here, and PartCAD does
not carry the ROS stack as a dependency; and URDF's primitive shapes have to be
turned into geometry, which needs OCCT and which the core process never loads.
The core only receives plain data back.

**Nothing is rewritten that does not have to be.** A ``<mesh>`` becomes a part
that reads the very file the URDF named, at the path the URDF named it by; the
``<origin>`` that places it becomes a PartCAD location, not a transform baked
into new geometry. Only ``<box>``/``<cylinder>``/``<sphere>`` are generated,
because there is no file to point at. So a link with several visuals becomes a
*sub-assembly* of one part per visual, addressable as
``<assembly>/<link>/<name or index>``, and a link with one becomes the single
part ``<assembly>/<link>``.

**Nothing is stored in a container of its own either.** What the URDF says
about a link's physics is copied field by field into named PartCAD properties
with PartCAD units - see "The property tables" below - and URDF content nothing
there knows about stops the import instead of being tucked away under a
format-specific key. The link's *name* is the part's name and the joint tree is
this very file, so neither is recorded a second time.

The tree this returns has the same node shape wrapper_import_assy produces from
a STEP assembly, so both feed the same node handler and end up as the identical
in-memory representation an ASSY file produces:

    assembly node:  {"type": "assembly", "name", "location", "links": [...]}
    part node:      {"type": "part", "name", "location", "part_file",
                     "part_type", "scale"}

Alongside the tree, the response carries the flat ``links`` and ``joints``
tables that ``pc convert assembly -t assy`` needs to write an ASSY file, its
parts and the interfaces its joints turn into.

#
#   * URDF content nothing here knows about stops the import with an error that
#     names it. When URDF grows a field, or one turns up in the wild, *extend
#     the table* - do not widen the error and do not add a passthrough.
#   * The export does the reverse: a PartCAD property URDF has no spelling for
