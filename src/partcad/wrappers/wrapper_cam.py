    A solid a machine can make is closed: every edge of it is shared by two
    faces. A free boundary is an edge that is not, so a count above zero is a
    shape with a hole in its surface - a surface model, or a solid that failed
    to sew - and 'CamTest' reports it as a part nothing can be made from.

def flatness(request):
    """How much of the shape lies in the horizontal planes at its top and bottom.

    The question a sheet metal blank has to answer: it is a piece of sheet, so
    the plane through its highest point and the plane through its lowest one
    each meet it in a face rather than touching it at an edge or a point. The
    area of that meeting is the answer, and zero means it is not a blank.

    Computed as the area of the shape's own horizontal planar faces that sit at
    each extreme, which is exactly the area of the intersection and costs no
    boolean: a plane cannot cut a solid at the very limit of it, so anything the
    plane meets there is surface the shape already has. Doing it as a boolean
    instead would depend on a tolerance to decide whether the plane and the face
    are the same plane, which is the thing being measured.

    'z_min' and 'z_max' come from the bounding box rather than from those faces,
    and that is the whole reason the box is here: a dome has a horizontal face
    at its base and nothing at its top, and only the box knows where its top is.
    The box is asked for the geometry's own extent - no gap, and not inflated by
    the shapes' tolerances - because the question is about a plane through the
    extreme point and not about a plane near it.
