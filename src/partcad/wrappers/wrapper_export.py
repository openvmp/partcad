"""Sandbox entry point for an export/render implementation.

Every output file PartCAD writes - the built-in formats in '//builtin/export'
and '//builtin/render' as much as a format a package implements itself - is
produced by a Python script run through here. This meta-wrapper runs inside the
PartCAD sandbox (so the script it runs may import OCP / build123d / cadquery),
executes that script with 'runpy', and serializes its verdict back to
'Shape.render_async()'.

The script to run is the wrapper's third argument, after the output path and the
working directory; see SCRIPT_ARGUMENT below for why it is an argument rather
than part of the request.

The script is executed with these globals available:

    request  -- the shape ('request["wrapped"]') plus every export parameter
                declared for this format (see '//builtin/export/partcad.yaml'),
                along with 'shape_name', 'shape_kind' and 'shape_type' so the
                script can adapt to what it was handed
    path     -- the absolute path of the file to write

A 'cae:' implementation is run through here too, and is handed three more keys:
'analysis' ("fea"/"cfd"), the 'fix' and 'load' the part declared, and 'boundary',
the ports each of them landed on with their locations (see 'partcad.cae'). It
answers with the same dict plus one key of its own:

    output = {"success": True, "findings": [...]}   # wrote the model, and found this

'findings' is a JSON array - strings or objects with a 'message' and, optionally,
a 'severity' and a 'where'. An empty one means the analysis found nothing to
report, which is what "pc test" requires of a part.

and reports what happened in one of two ways, whichever suits it:

    output = {"success": True}                        # wrote the file
    output = {"success": False, "exception": "..."}   # did not

or by defining a function, which is called with the same two values:

    def process(path, request): ...                   # returns the dict above

Both '__file__' and the run name '__partcad_export__' are set on the script, so
it can gate any top-level work ("if __name__ == '__partcad_export__':") and
remain importable by its siblings - which is how the PNG and DXF renderers
reuse the SVG one.

A format that declared 'properties: true' finds 'request["properties"]' holding
what each shape reports about itself - its material, its colour, its physics -
keyed by the full name the shape carries. See 'properties_index()'.

# adjusted to match (see 'tools/containers/_common/pc-container-json-rpc.py').

# says *about* a node (the URDF exporter names each link after the node and
# reads its location as a joint origin) declares 'decode: false', because
# decoding keeps the tree's shape but only its geometry: names and labels are
# gone and placements are baked in rather than left as data.

# declares it and never sees the index.

# The key the core puts what each shape inherits from its material under, keyed
# by the same full name the index below is keyed by. A shape says what it is
# made of by *name*, and turning ':aluminium' into a coefficient of friction
# means resolving it against the package that wrote it and then loading the
# package that catalogues it - which the core can do and a sandbox cannot. So
# the facts arrive already resolved, per shape, and are merged into the index
# below underneath whatever each shape said about itself. See
# 'partcad.material.physics_by_shape()'.

    name an exporter looks a node up by, so they are here for an implementation
    that walks the tree ('decode: false') *and* for one that is handed live
    geometry ('decode: true'), whose decoding throws every envelope away.

    What the shape's *material* says is folded in here too, underneath what the
    shape itself says: a part that states a friction of its own keeps it, and one
    that only states what it is made of gets the material's. That way an exporter
    reads 'physics' and never learns that materials exist - which is what keeps
    all three of them (URDF, SDFormat, MJCF) agreeing about it for free.

    Only shapes that report something appear. A shape with no name cannot be
    looked up and is skipped, but its children are still walked.
