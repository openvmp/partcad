"""The built-in G-code route implementation (see '//builtin/cam' in partcad.yaml).

What it produces is a 2.5D route: the object's outline, offset by the radius of
the cutter, cut at a series of depths. That is what a CNC router does to sheet
goods and what a mill does to a plate, and it is arithmetic on the object's own
geometry rather than a simulation of anything - which is why PartCAD ships it,
where it ships no solver.

The outline is a **section**, taken at the bottom of the cut. For a prismatic
object - a panel, a plate, a gasket, anything cut out of stock of one thickness
- that is the same outline at every depth and there is nothing more to say. For
an object whose cross-section changes over the cut, no single outline is right:
following the widest gouges nothing but leaves material, following the narrowest
cuts into the part. This one follows the bottom and says so, as a warning naming
how much the two ends of the cut differ by, because a route produced from an
outline the user did not expect is the one failure that looks like a success all
the way to the machine.

The three operations differ in which side of that outline the tool runs on:

    'profile'   outward by the tool's radius on the outer boundary, inward on
                every hole. The object survives the cut at its nominal size.
                Holes are cut first, so that the part is still held by its stock
                while they are.
    'pocket'    inward by the tool's radius, and then inward again by
                'stepover' of the tool's diameter until nothing is left. Emitted
                innermost ring first, so the wall is cut last and by a tool that
                is only engaged on one side.
    'engrave'   along the outline itself, offset by nothing. What a V-bit or a
                drag knife does.

Every curve is emitted as G1 moves within 'tolerance' of the true curve, rather
than as G2/G3 arcs. An arc word is only an arc while the plane it was written in
survives the post-processor, and 'tolerance' is one number that says exactly what
the approximation costs; two of them (the arc and the tolerance) say less.

The file is byte-stable by construction: nothing in it is a timestamp, a host
name or a version, so the same object and the same parameters produce the same
bytes on any machine. That is what makes a route something a repository can hold
and a reviewer can diff.
