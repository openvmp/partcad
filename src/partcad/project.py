    layer by layer if every combination of layers had been declared in advance,
    which is the opposite of what a parameter is for.

    Only the names this reference actually sets are declared, and only where the
    object declares nothing of that name itself: a declaration that is there is
    the one that carries the 'desc', the 'enum' and the default its author
    meant. The type's own default goes in as the default, so an unset parameter
    reads back exactly as it did before anything was declared, and the type
    witnesses its type ('config.declared_parameter_type').

    A name the type does not contribute is left alone, and is rejected moments

        An assembly is built more than once - asking for one of these parts by

        than two declarations claiming one name, so it is handed back rather
        than refused ('register_object').

        The two passes also overlap: 'Assembly.do_instantiate' decides whether
        to assemble by reading 'children' without a lock, so a thread rendering
        the assembly and a thread resolving one of its parts by name can both
        be walking the same links. Whichever gets here second then creates a
        part under a name the first has just taken, and 'register_object'

        is handed back. The loser's own part is inert: 'register_object' is what
        raised, and '_create()' does nothing else with it afterwards.

        Caught rather than prevented with the part's own lock, which is what
        this used to do. 'get_object' holds the package lock while it takes the
        part lock, and 'register_object' below takes the package lock while
        this holds the part lock - opposite orders on the same two locks, which
        is a deadlock as soon as two threads resolve parts of one package at
        once. There is only one lock in this now, and it is 'register_object's,
