"""The 'software' a package ships beside its parts and assemblies.

A product is rarely hardware alone: the board in it runs a firmware image, the
controller boots a disk image, the host tool that talks to it is a binary. None
of that is geometry, so 'Software' is deliberately **not** a 'Shape': there is
nothing to tessellate, render, export or measure, and nothing here inherits the
machinery that exists for those. What software is, always, is a *file* -- and
the digital thread PartCAD maintains is only whole if that file is identified as
precisely as the parts around it are.

That is what this module is for. A 'Software' object knows where its file is
(the 'path' in the package, or what 'fileFrom' pulls it from), what it is for,
and -- for a file that is not kept in the package's own repository -- the hash
that says it is the right one. The bill of materials of an assembly lists it
beside the parts, with the revision of the package it came from, so that
"which firmware went into this unit" has the same kind of answer as "which
bracket went into this unit".

          * The file is reproducible: the package carries it, so its revision
