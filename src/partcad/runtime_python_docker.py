"""A sandbox whose interpreter lives in a container and whose files do not.

This is the ``venv`` sandbox with the interpreter somewhere else. The virtual
environment is still created, still installed into by pip, and still locked and
guarded by the machinery in ``runtime_python`` -- it simply lives in a directory
the container has mounted, and every command that touches it runs over there.

Which is the whole reason for mounting rather than copying. Because the sandbox
directory is at the same path on both sides (see ``docker_mount``), a virtual
environment built inside the container is a virtual environment the host can
read, ``pip`` installs survive the container being replaced, and the environment
lock, the install guards and the cache go on working without knowing that any of
this happened. A design that shipped files into the image instead would need a
second copy of all of it.

What the container buys over ``venv`` is that the interpreter, the compilers and
the native libraries come from an image somebody built once, rather than from
whatever the host happens to have -- and that a package needing something pip
cannot install can name an image carrying it. What it costs is a container
runtime.

The one thing that does **not** go through the container's RPC service is this.
``PC_CONTAINER_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`` exists because that service takes commands
from a caller who may be somewhere else and may not be trusted; ``docker exec``
here is PartCAD running a command on its own machine, in a container it started
itself, against files it already has. There is no boundary to enforce, and
pretending otherwise would mean routing pip through an allowlist that PartCAD
writes and PartCAD checks.

    filesystem resolves those paths against a different one and Docker creates

    probe and not a guess about the environment. The question is not "am I in a
    container" but "does that daemon see this directory", and one container that
    looks for a file answers it.

    A ``False`` makes the sandbox unavailable rather than degraded. There is no
    halfway: PartCAD would be handing a wrapper paths that mean something else
