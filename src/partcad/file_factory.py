    """Why this declaration cannot be obtained again identically, or None.

    Manufacturing is repetition, so everything that goes into a product has to
    be gettable a second time and be the same thing. There are three ways a
    declaration can promise that, and any one of them is enough:

      * **It is bought.** A 'vendor' and an 'sku' name a thing to order, and
        ordering it again is what "the same again" means for it. Whatever file
        the declaration also carries is a drawing of what arrives, not the
        identity of it. Only a part or an assembly can say this - the schema
        gives 'vendor'/'sku' to those two alone - which is why a sketch or a
        piece of software has to fall through to the file rules below.
      * **The package carries the file.** Its revision identifies the file:
        fetch the package again at that commit and the same bytes come back.
      * **The file is pinned.** A fetched file is whatever the remote served at
        the time, and 'fileHash' is what says which bytes were meant.

    A declaration that does none of the three has no answer to "which one went
    in", which is why the manufacturing test refuses it (see
    'ManufacturabilityTest.reproducibility_failure').

    'fileHash' stays optional in the declaration all the same, for every kind of
    object: a package that does not pin its download is not malformed, it has
    only said less about itself, and demanding one of every package that ever
    pulled a vendor file from a URL is not something a schema should do.

    A file served by a repository plugin is treated as reproducible here, and
    that is a gap rather than a conclusion: such a package has no revision of
    its own either, so strictly the same reasoning applies. A 'fileHash' given
    for one is verified like any other; it is simply not required yet, because
    nothing has been put in place for a plugin-backed package to pin what its
    plugin serves.
