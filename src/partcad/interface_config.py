"""What an interface's 'parameters:' section holds, and how the two kinds are told apart.

An interface has declared **freedom of movement** in 'parameters:' since
interfaces existed: 'moveX', 'turnZ', a custom name with the 'dir' it moves
along. What it could not declare was what a part and a sketch declare in the
section of the same name - the **construction parameters** the object is built
from, which 'm-thru;size=4,depth=3' sets.

Both live in 'parameters:' now, because "the same way as for a part" is the
point of the feature and a second section would be a second thing to learn. They
are told apart by their own contents rather than by where they are written, and
the two vocabularies barely overlap: a freedom-of-movement parameter states a
range and an axis ('min', 'max', 'dir'), and a construction parameter states a
value type and a default ('type: float', 'enum', 'desc'). 'default' is the only
key both use, and 'type' is shared but with disjoint values.

So the rule is, in order:

1. One of the six predefined movement names ('moveX'/'moveY'/'moveZ',
   'turnX'/'turnY'/'turnZ', and the hyphenated spellings a 'mates:' section
   uses) is freedom of movement, whatever it looks like.
2. The short list form '[min, max, default]' is freedom of movement. A
   construction parameter has no list form on an interface: 'array' is not one
   of the types a parameter may declare.
3. A declaration stating 'min', 'max' or 'dir', or 'type: move'/'type: turn',
   is freedom of movement. None of those four keys means anything to a part's
   parameter.
4. Anything else is a construction parameter, read exactly as a part's.

Every freedom-of-movement parameter that PartCAD's schema has ever accepted is
caught by 1 or 3: a custom name is *required* to state its 'dir'. So a
declaration written before this existed keeps the meaning it had, and there is
no shape that could be read as either.
