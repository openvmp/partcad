"""What manufacturing tolerance a CAD file states, read off the bytes.

A part that is going to be made has to say how precisely, and for most part
types the only place that can be said is the declaration: a mesh is a surface
with nothing in it to state a tolerance, and a script that builds a solid says
nothing about how well it has to be cut. A STEP file is the exception. AP242
carries the whole of GD&T -- a plus/minus tolerance on a dimension, a
straightness or a position tolerance on a feature -- so a part read from one may
well already say how precisely it has to be made, in the file, and asking its
author to repeat that in 'partcad.yaml' is asking for two answers that can
disagree.

So this reads the file. Not all STEP files carry any of it (a great many are
geometry and nothing else, which is why the declaration keeps an optional
'tolerance:' of its own), and the ones that do rarely carry *one* of it: a real
drawing tolerances several features, each to what that feature needs. There is
then no single number that is true of the part, and this says so with a NaN
rather than picking one of them -- see 'reduce()'.

Nothing here needs a CAD kernel. A STEP file is ISO 10303-21, which is text: a
list of '#<id> = ENTITY(<arguments>);' records, and the handful of entity types
that state a tolerance can be read straight out of it. That is the same trade
'brep_inspect' makes for topology, and for the same reason -- the core process
holds no live shapes, and putting this question to a sandbox would cost a
process per part to answer a question the bytes already answer.

What is read:

* 'TOLERANCE_VALUE(#lower, #upper)', the value of a plus/minus tolerance on a
  dimension. Both bounds are length measures, and what is taken from the pair is
  the largest deviation it permits -- 'max(|lower|, |upper|)'. That is the
  reading a manufacturer can be held to: a shop that works to it satisfies the
  file, whichever side of nominal the bound is on.

* The magnitude of a 'GEOMETRIC_TOLERANCE', and of every subtype of it --
  flatness, position, runout and the rest. A subtype is written either as a
  simple record ("FLATNESS_TOLERANCE('','',#1,#2)") or as one entity of a
  complex instance ("(GEOMETRIC_TOLERANCE(...)POSITION_TOLERANCE())"), so what
  is matched is the shape of the argument list rather than a list of names:
  anything ending in 'TOLERANCE' whose first two arguments are strings and whose
  third is a reference is a geometric tolerance and its third argument is the
  magnitude. A list of names would have to be kept up to date with a standard
  that keeps adding to it.

Deliberately *not* read: the 'UNCERTAINTY_MEASURE_WITH_UNIT' every STEP file
carries. It is the precision the geometry was written to (1e-07 mm, typically),
not a tolerance anybody is being asked to hold, and reading it would give every
STEP file ever exported a manufacturing tolerance of a ten-millionth of a
millimetre.

Units are resolved rather than assumed. PartCAD works in millimetres and most
STEP files are written in them, but a file written in inches states so, and
reading 0.005 inch as 0.005 mm would be wrong by a factor of 25.4 with nothing
to show for it.
