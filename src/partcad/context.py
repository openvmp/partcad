    A public DNS resolver, historically, and that is the right question on a
    host whose packets go straight out. It is the wrong one on a host whose
    traffic is confined to an HTTP proxy -- a corporate network, a container,
    the sandbox a cloud coding agent runs in. There nothing but the proxy
    answers: 53 to 8.8.8.8 goes nowhere, while git and every download go
    through the proxy and work, so PartCAD calls itself offline in an
    environment where it can fetch everything it needs.

    What follows is silent, which is what makes it expensive. 'is_connected()'
    gates the clone in 'project_factory_git', so an import is never even
    attempted: it resolves to whatever is already on disk, and a package that
    was never fetched is reported as a missing configuration file rather than
    as a network problem.

    So ask about the path this process's traffic actually takes. Where one is
    configured that is the proxy and only the proxy -- reaching anything else
    would prove nothing, and failing to reach it would be evidence of nothing.
    Otherwise it stays the resolver it has always been.

    Module level rather than a method: 'Context' is wrapped by
    'telemetry.instrument()', which hands every callable in the class a 'self'.
    One address either way, so this costs no more than it did.
