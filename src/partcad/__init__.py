# Must come before anything that can pull OCP in. VTK, which the OCP build we
# use links against, bundles its own older copy of expat and exports it under
# the standard XML_* names. Once that is in the process, the standard library's
# pyexpat resolves against it and fails with "undefined symbol:
# XML_SetReparseDeferralEnabled" on any interpreter built against expat 2.6+.
# Loading pyexpat first pins it to the right library. It matters since
# build123d 0.11, which imports IPython (-> prompt_toolkit -> xml.dom.minidom)
# at import time and so trips over this on the way in.

# The shared lightweight utilities (logging, telemetry, user config) live in the
# standalone `partcad_utils` package, so the thin CLI/daemon clients can import
# them without pulling in the CAD kernel. Alias them back under the `partcad.*`
# namespace *before* any submodule below does `from . import logging` /
# `from . import telemetry` / `from .user_config import ...`, so every existing
# import resolves to the very same module object — shared mutable state such as
# `logging.had_errors` and `logging.ops` included (a plain re-export would fork
# those globals).

# This module object, to bind the aliases onto below.
#
# Deliberately not `globals()`: this package has a submodule named `globals`, and
# `from .globals import ...` further down binds it as an attribute of the
# package. On a plain import that happens after this loop and nothing notices,
# but a *reload* re-executes this body against the module dictionary the first
# execution left behind -- where `globals` is that submodule. The builtin is
# shadowed by it, so `globals()` raised `TypeError: 'module' object is not
# callable` and every reload of `partcad` failed.
#
# The daemon reloads `partcad` on each `activate` to reset PartCAD's global state
# between package loads (`partcad_service_json_rpc.core.session.load_partcad`),
# and the VS Code extension activates on every connection -- so this broke the
# second and every later window against a warm daemon, while the first worked.

# anyway because 'shape' imports it, and that is exactly the dependency the
# 'plugin' line above exists not to have.
