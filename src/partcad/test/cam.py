        """Why this object cannot be made again, or None if it can.

        Manufacturing is repetition: the run after this one has to produce the
        same thing. An object read from a file the package fetches rather than
        carries cannot promise that unless it says which bytes it expects -
        'fileHash' next to 'fileUrl' - because the URL is free to serve
        something else tomorrow, and then the part is quietly a different part.
        So the rule is not "the file is available", which it may well be, but
        "the file is identified".

        A part or an assembly has another way out: a 'vendor' and an 'sku' say
        what to order, and ordering the same SKU again is what "the same again"
        means for a bought thing - the file it also carries is a drawing of what
        arrives rather than the identity of it. A sketch and a piece of software
        cannot say that (the schema gives 'vendor'/'sku' to parts and assemblies
        alone), so for them it is the file or nothing.

        'fileHash' stays optional in the declaration (see
        'file_factory.unreproducible_reason', which is this rule whole and is
        shared with the 'Software' lint check). This is the one place it is
        insisted on, and only of what is actually going to be made: a package
        may pull a vendor's model from a URL and never claim it is
        manufacturable.

        Read from the *final* configuration, so an alias or an enrich is judged
        on the declaration it resolves to rather than on its own, which says
        nothing about where any file comes from.

        A shape's cache key covers what the shape is built from, and the
        software it ships with is not that: a part's key does not move when its
        'software:' does. Without this, correcting a mistyped 'fileHash' - or
        pointing the part at a different image altogether - would be answered
        with the cached failure of the declaration that was replaced, which is
        the one thing a test must never do.

        The object's own 'fileHash' is in here for the same reason, and so is
        where its file comes from: 'reproducibility_failure()' reads both, and
        neither moves the shape's cache key either.

        Note what is being folded in: the *declared* text a package wrote down,
        which is what those two methods read. Not the content of the files, and
        not any hash PartCAD computed - re-hashing every image to decide whether

        A part that is going to be made has to say how precisely, and there are

        read from, the 'tolerance' object-type parameter of the homogeneous
        types. 'get_tolerance()' is what knows which of them applies to this
        part; this only judges the answer, so that "how precisely is this made"
        has one reader and not one per caller.

        Three answers, and each means something different:

        * None - the part has no way to say at all. Its type takes no tolerance
          and its file states none, so this is a fact about the type rather than
          about the declaration, and the message says which type.
        * 0.0 - nothing was said by a part that could have said. It reads as a
          demand for perfect precision, which is not something a manufacturer can
          be asked for.
        * NaN - the file states several tolerances that are not the same. That is
          a part tolerated feature by feature, which is a *better* answer than one
          number and not a missing one, so it passes: the file goes to the
          manufacturer, and it is the file that says how precisely each feature
          has to be made.

        Checked here, in the part path of the CAM test, rather than in a sibling
        test class: the siblings ('cam-additive', 'cam-subtractive',
        'cam-forming') each check the geometry for one manufacturing method,
        while this applies to a part however it is made, and it needs exactly the
        purchased-or-manufactured determination this method has just made.
