"""The `cam` check `pc test` runs: an object that asks to be cut can be cut.

An object that declares a `cam:` section has said it is made on a machine. This
check puts that to the test the only way there is -- it produces the route and
sees whether one comes back. A part passes when a route was written; it fails
when the section is wrong, when the implementation cannot be resolved, or when
the implementation was asked and delivered nothing.

It is the exact shape of the `fea`/`cfd` checks beside it, and for the same
reasons:

* Only a **sketch or a part**. An assembly is put together rather than cut, and
  a scene is an arrangement of things that were each cut on their own, so
  neither has an outline a machine could follow.
* Only an object that **declares the section**. A `pc test -r` over a package
  tree would otherwise start a CAD sandbox for every bolt in it, and a bolt with
  no `cam:` has nothing to be routed. Declaring `cam:` is how a user says "check
  this one", which is why the check needs no flag of its own.

What it does *not* share with those two is where the file goes. An analysis
writes its model beside the package and keeps it, because the model is the
answer somebody asked for; a route produced by a check is a by-product, and one
left beside the package would be indistinguishable from the one `pc cam` writes
-- checked in by accident, or read as current long after the part moved on. So
this writes into a temporary directory and deletes it. What the check keeps is
the verdict.

**This is not `partcad.test.manufacturability`**, which is the check that asks
whether an object can be made or bought *at all*: whether its geometry suits the
method it declares, whether what it is made of is reproducible, whether a
supplier could be found. That one was called `cam` until `pc cam` existed, at
which point one word was answering two questions. This one asks the narrower and
more concrete thing: run the post-processor, and see if a program comes out.
