    """Fail a part that is inside out.

    A solid's faces are oriented: outward for material on the inside of them,
    inward for material outside. Get that backwards and the shape still builds,
    still renders, still exports, and still measures the right size - a picture
    of it is indistinguishable from a picture of the right thing. What breaks is
    the arithmetic. OCCT reports such a solid's volume as negative, and every
    boolean against it returns a number with no relation to any shape.

    This was found in LDraw parts meshed from triangles: LDraw declares winding
    per file with its BFC metadata, the mesher ignored it, and every LEGO part
    came out inverted. Brick 2 x 4 measured -1939.6 mm^3, and two copies of it
    100 mm apart - sharing, necessarily, nothing - intersected to 2282 mm^3.
    Nothing reported it, because nothing asked. Anything built on booleans is
    wrong on such a part: interference, CAM, FEA, the volume in a bill of
    materials.

    What this does not fail is a solid that is merely not *valid*. Plenty of
    usable geometry is not, and intersects perfectly well regardless; failing
    it would condemn an entire library that works. That is reported and passed.

    A shape holding no solid at all - a sketch, a shell, a wire - is not inside
    out and is passed over. That is decided on what the shape *is*, not on what
    it asks for: there is no way for a part to turn this check off. A solid of
    negative volume is broken whatever it was meant to be, and a check an object
    can exclude itself from is a check that reports on the objects that did not
    need checking.
