"""The shared body of the CAE checks `pc test` runs: FEA, and CFD.

A part passes when the analysis has **no findings**. That is the whole verdict,
and it is deliberately not a threshold PartCAD holds an opinion about: what
counts as too much stress or too much drag is the solver's judgement, expressed
by whether it says anything at all. PartCAD's part of the bargain is to run the
implementation the user configured and to report what it reported.

Two things bound how expensive this is, and both are the same gate:

* Only a **part** is analysed. An assembly is a set of parts that each carry
  their own boundary conditions, and a load on the whole of one says nothing
  about which member bears it.
* Only a part that **declares the section**. A `pc test -r` over a package tree
  would otherwise start a solver for every bolt in it, and a bolt with no
  `fea:` has nothing for a solver to be told. Declaring `fea:` is how a user
  says "check this one", which is why the check needs no flag of its own.

Everything else - which implementation, what the boundary conditions mean, what
units they are in - is `partcad.cae` and `Shape.analyze_async()`, shared with
`pc cae fea` so that the test and the command cannot disagree about a part.

Named after what it checks, like `manufacturability.py` and `connect.py` beside
it, and emphatically *not* `cae_test.py`: that matches pytest's default `*_test.py`
pattern, so any collection that reaches `src/` imports this module as a test
file -- under a package name that does not resolve -- and the run dies during
collection rather than running anything.

        A failure by default, and that default is the whole contract of this
        check: a part asked a question, the implementation was asked it, and
        nothing came back. Whatever the reason -- no solver, no mesher, a crash
        -- the part has no answer, and a check that passed anyway would make
        `fea:` decoration.

        The exception is a machine with **no container runtime**, and it is the
        only one. A container is how an implementation brings what pip cannot
        install: an image can carry a solver, a mesher and the shared libraries
        under them, and nothing else PartCAD has can. On a machine with no
        container runtime there is no arrangement under which such an
        implementation could have been given what it needs, so the question was
        never really put -- and the honest verdict for a question nobody could
        ask is a skip.

        That the implementation declares an image or not does not change it, and
        deliberately: an implementation is free to say nothing about containers
        and still need a solver, and reading the declaration would make the
        verdict depend on how well its author documented themselves rather than
        on what this machine can do. What the declaration is good for is the
        *message*, which names the image when there is one.

        Once a runtime answers, the excuse is gone entirely -- a registry that
        cannot be reached, an image that will not start, a solver missing from
        the image are all things somebody can fix, and calling them
        "unavailable" would hide exactly the failures a plugin's own CI exists
        to catch. That is the half that keeps this narrow enough to be worth
        having, and it is why continuous integration, which has a container
        runtime, sees every one of these as a failure.

        "Answers" is not "answers *here*", though, and the `remote` sandbox is
        the case that makes the difference: it runs the implementation in a
        container on somebody else's machine and needs no daemon on this one. A
        host configured that way has a container runtime in every sense that
        matters to this question -- one carried the analysis -- so a failure
        there is a failure, and reading the local daemon would have excused it.

        Either way the reader gets the same sentence, which is the point of
        `dysfunction_report()`: what was asked, what it said, and which platform
        it did not work on. A skip that said less than a failure would be a way

        **There is one way to pass: the analysis ran and reported no findings.**
        Everything else is a failure, and the report says which of them it was.
        A part that declares `fea:` has asked a question, and any answer other
        than "nothing to report" is something a user has to act on:

        * the part declared the section wrongly;
        * the implementation could not be resolved -- not a dependency, did not
          load, declares no such file type;
        * the implementation resolved and could not run: no mesher, no solver,
          an unprovisionable sandbox, a crash;
        * the analysis ran and reported findings.

        **Not running is not a reason to skip.** A skip says the question does
        not apply here; a plugin that was asked to do something and did not do it
        has failed, and calling that a skip reports a part as checked when
        nothing checked it. That was this check's earlier behaviour -- a missing
        `ccx` warned and passed -- and it hid two things worth failing over: a
        CFD implementation that never converges, and a plugin that cannot be
        installed on this platform at all.

        **Nothing is a skip any more**, including a machine with no container
        runtime. That one was a skip while a `container:` meant "a sandbox is
        not enough" -- nothing was asked, because the thing that asks could not
        start, so the verdict said nothing about the implementation or the part.
        A `dockerImage` is a different claim: it names the sandbox to prefer,
        while the same package's requirements say how to run without one. So a
        machine with no container runtime is a machine that has to supply the
        dependencies itself, and a part that asked a question and got no answer
        has failed either way.

        What that absence still earns is a sentence PartCAD has to write, since
        the implementation never ran to write one: both remedies, because either
        fixes it and only the reader knows which is easier where they are.

        The consequence is real and is the point: declaring `fea:` in a shared
        package makes `pc test` fail for everyone who has not installed what the
        implementation needs. That is what declaring it means. A package that
        does not want the whole world running a solver should not declare the
        section, which is the same gate that keeps `pc test -r` from starting a
        solver for every bolt in a tree.

        What the failure must carry is *why*, because the reasons need different
        actions: install a solver, use another machine, or fix the part. The
        implementation is what knows which, so whatever it said is reported
        verbatim -- see `partcad.cae.dysfunction_report()`.
