"""Is this sheet metal part one a brake could actually produce?

A sheet metal part is not described the way the other manufactured parts are. It
is not made from stock: it is made from a *flat piece*, which somebody else made
and which already carries the outline and the holes, and the whole of what the
sheet metal process contributes is the bends. So the declaration names two
things - the part that goes in ('source') and the sketch that says where the
bends are ('instructions') - and they are what this checks.

Two questions, and each of them is about one of those:

* The blank has to be flat, top and bottom. What goes into a brake is a piece of
  sheet, so the horizontal plane through its highest point and the one through
  its lowest each meet it in an area rather than touching it at a point. A part
  that fails this is not a blank - most often it is the bent part itself, named
  by mistake.
* Every bend has to say what it is. Two identical lines on a drawing are a bend
  up through 90 degrees and a bend down through 30, and nothing about the lines
  says which; so each of them carries an angle, an inner radius and a direction,
  and a line that carries none of that is a bend nobody can make.

What this does not check is the geometry of the part itself against those
instructions. Whether the bends produce the shape the part declares is a
question for the day PartCAD bends the blank itself; until then the part is what
its own type built, and these are the manufacturing inputs beside it.

        Everything it reads is somewhere else. The part's own hash covers what
        the part is built from, and 'manufacturing:' is not that - it is one of
        the keys a shape's key deliberately leaves out ('_NON_GEOMETRIC_CONFIG_KEYS'
        in shape.py), because naming a blank does not change the geometry of the
        part that names it. So without this, correcting a mistyped reference -
        or editing the bend angles in the drawing the reference points at -
        would be answered with the cached verdict of the declaration that was
        replaced, which is the one thing a test must never do.

        Two things go in for each of the two references: the reference as
        written, which is what changes when the part is re-pointed, and the
        cache key of what it resolves to, which is what changes when that object
        does. The second is the whole reason this is asynchronous: a shape has
        no correct key until the files it is built from are on disk, which is
        what 'get_cache_key_async()' waits for.

        An object that cannot be resolved, or that is not cached in its own
        right, contributes its reference and an empty key. That is a verdict
        this test is about to fail anyway, and failing it is cheaper than
        deciding here what an unresolvable reference should key as.

        Asked of parts only, exactly as 'test()' below is. An assembly's
        'manufacturing:' is a different vocabulary in the same spelling - every
        'type: assy' assembly is given 'method: assy' by AssemblyConfiguration -
        and reading one with 'PartConfiguration.get_manufacturing_data' reports
        the assembly's own method as an unknown *part* method. That is an error
        rather than a warning, so it does not merely read oddly: it fails
