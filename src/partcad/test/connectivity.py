    """Fail an assembly whose parts are placed in ways that do not add up.

    Three things, all of which an assembly can do while building perfectly and
    rendering plausibly.

    **The same part twice in the same place.** A generator that runs a loop one
    time too many, or a hand-written ASSY with a copy-pasted node whose location
    was not changed, produces two items occupying one space. Nothing looks
    wrong: the second is exactly behind the first in every view.

    **Two items connected to one port.** A stud takes one brick and a bolt hole
    takes one bolt. Where the joint is one that is genuinely made more than once
    - a shaft carrying several parts along its length, a rail - the interface
    says so with 'multiConnect: true' and this passes it.

    **An item anchored to nothing.** Every item after the first has to be put
    somewhere relative to what is already there. One placed by 'location:' in an
    assembly that otherwise connects by interface is floating in the coordinate
    system rather than attached to the thing it belongs to: it will be in the
    right place only for as long as nothing it sits on moves. This is reported
    rather than assumed wrong - an assembly may legitimately place everything by
    coordinates - so it only applies once something in the assembly does connect.

    Configured per assembly:

        assemblies:
          gearbox:
            connectivity:
              allowDuplicates: false   # two items in one place
              requireAnchored: true    # every item after the first connected
              skip: false
