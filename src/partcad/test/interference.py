    """Fail an assembly whose parts share space.

    The 'cad' test passes an assembly whose parts are all in the wrong place -
    it only asks whether the geometry instantiates. This asks where the parts
    ended up, which is the question an assembly is actually judged on, and the
    one nothing has been able to answer without a person looking at a render.

    The answer comes from a boolean common and the volume of what it produces.
    Bounding boxes are not enough: two boxes meeting says very little about two
    solids - a bracket around a shaft, an L around a corner, anything rotated -
    so they are used only to choose the pairs worth intersecting.

    What counts as sharing space is a threshold rather than 'any volume at all'.
    Parts meant to go together touch, and meshed geometry touching produces
    slivers, so an assembly that fits would otherwise fail. The default asks for
    a cubic millimetre; a package that wants to be stricter or looser can say so:

        assemblies:
          gearbox:
            interference:
              minVolume: 0.5      # mm^3 of shared space before it is reported
              minFraction: 0.01   # ...and/or that share of the smaller part
              ignore:             # pairs that are meant to interfere
                - [shaft, hub]
