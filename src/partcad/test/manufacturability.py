"""The `manufacturability` check `pc test` runs: can this object be had at all.

It asks the question a bill of materials depends on. For a part that is bought,
whether a supplier carries it; for one that is made, whether its geometry suits
the method it declares, whether a tolerance was stated, whether the files it is
built from are pinned well enough that the next run gets the same thing, and
whether the software it ships can be flashed. An assembly is asked it over
everything it is procured from, which is why this check runs the whole suite
from inside itself -- see `partcad.concurrency`.

The three siblings beside it (`manufacturability_additive_solid`,
`manufacturability_subtractive`, `manufacturability_forming`) each check the
geometry for one manufacturing method. This one applies to a part however it is
made.

**This check answered to the name `cam` until `pc cam` existed**, at which point
one word was answering two questions. `partcad.test.cam` is now the check that
produces the *route* -- the program a machine cuts the object with -- and this
one is `manufacturability`. Both are computer-aided manufacturing; they differ
in whether the answer is "yes, somebody can make this" or "here is the file that
makes it". `pc test -f` filters by name prefix, so `-f manufacturability`
selects this check and its three siblings and `-f cam` selects the route check
alone. The name is part of every cached verdict's key, so the first `pc test`
after the rename re-runs these checks once and then caches as before.

        Manufacturing is repetition: the run after this one has to produce the
        same thing. An object read from a file the package fetches rather than
        carries cannot promise that unless it says which bytes it expects -
        'fileHash' next to 'fileUrl' - because the URL is free to serve
        something else tomorrow, and then the part is quietly a different part.
        So the rule is not "the file is available", which it may well be, but
        "the file is identified".

        A part or an assembly has another way out: a 'vendor' and an 'sku' say
        what to order, and ordering the same SKU again is what "the same again"
        means for a bought thing - the file it also carries is a drawing of what
        arrives rather than the identity of it. A sketch and a piece of software
        cannot say that (the schema gives 'vendor'/'sku' to parts and assemblies
        alone), so for them it is the file or nothing.

        'fileHash' stays optional in the declaration (see
        'file_factory.unreproducible_reason', which is this rule whole and is
        shared with the 'Software' lint check). This is the one place it is
        insisted on, and only of what is actually going to be made: a package
        may pull a vendor's model from a URL and never claim it is
        manufacturable.

        Read from the *final* configuration, so an alias or an enrich is judged
        on the declaration it resolves to rather than on its own, which says
        nothing about where any file comes from.

        A shape's cache key covers what the shape is built from, and the

        'software:' does. Without this, correcting a mistyped 'fileHash' - or
        pointing the part at a different image altogether - would be answered
        with the cached failure of the declaration that was replaced, which is
        the one thing a test must never do.

        The object's own 'fileHash' is in here for the same reason, and so is
        where its file comes from: 'reproducibility_failure()' reads both, and
        neither moves the shape's cache key either.
