        That line is a `WARNING` rather than an `INFO` on purpose: a skip is a
        question nobody answered, and the run it happens in reports success. A
        reader scrolling past `INFO` would be told a package passed on a machine
        where a third of it never ran.

        It is not an `ERROR`, though, and the difference is whether anything
        could have been asked. A `WARNING` says the machine is not equipped;
        `failed()` says the implementation was equipped and did not deliver. Only
        the second is a bug in something, and only the second stops the command.

        The caller sets `NOT_CACHEABLE` alongside this for the same reason it
        does around a failure: what makes it a skip is a property of the machine,
        and nothing that changes it changes the cache key.
