    """Fail a shape that came out with no size to it.

    A part can instantiate perfectly and still be wrong in a way nothing looks
    at: geometry that resolves to a sheet, a sliver or nothing at all. The
    'cad' test asks whether a shape was produced, not whether what was produced
    is a solid anybody meant.

    The failure this is written for came from a repository plugin that meshes
    LDraw parts. A part is mostly references, and a subfile that could not be
    fetched was skipped in silence, so a 2 x 2 round brick 9.6 mm tall meshed
    into a flat disc about a millimetre thick. It rendered; it exported; it
    passed every test there was. Only a picture showed it, and only because the
    towers built out of it looked wrong.

    So: a shape whose bounding box is empty, or which is flat to within a
    thousandth of a millimetre in any direction, is reported.

    There is no way for a part to turn this off. A part that measured a
    millimetre where it should have measured ten is broken whatever it says
    about itself, and a check an object can exclude itself from is a check that
    reports on the objects that did not need checking. A kind of object that is
    flat by nature is passed over here, on what it *is* rather than on what it
    asks for: that is what the two clauses below do for a sketch and for an
    assembly.
